
This is a simple text-based game about an open world. The goal is to collect the muffins scattered throughout
the city. This was primarily a project used to teach myself Tcl.

Currently, the game is unfinished. If you get the "You find yourself fading away" prompt, that means that that
area has not been written yet.
