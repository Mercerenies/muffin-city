
This is a simple text-based game about an open world. The goal is to
collect the muffins scattered throughout the city.

This started as a way for me to learn the programming language Tcl and
sort of took off in its own right. You can see my (vague, scribbled)
plans for a lot of the game in `map.org`. Mainly, there will be 12
major areas of the game, each containing roughly 3 muffins (give or
take) to be collected. The goal is to collect them all and take them
to a special place.

Currently, the game is largely a work-in-progress. You can definitely
play the areas which have been written in, but only six muffins are
currently attainable. If you get the "You drift away from spacetime"
prompt, that means that that area has not been written yet.
