* NOTES

** Ideas
 + Cave will lead somewhere cool if you have a light (inverse city)
 + Given gift if falsely imprisoned (according to Warden), maybe
   Religious Artifact
 + Pirates will eventually attack the dream ship, and if you raid them
   you'll get a Religious Artifact
 + Past the fire pits, there should be multiple rooms which are
   accessible, not just the freight elevator
 + Merchant-bot has two items (one at a ridiculous price); there is a
   quest to kill him, which leads to the warehouse office. At that
   time, Merchant-bot 2 takes over and sells the expensive one for
   less
 + Going to the past and requesting an item from the pawnbroker will
   result in that item being available the next day
 + Todd wants to rebel against Merchant-bot and leaves clues to help
   you do so
 + Help someone escape from prison by creating a diversion on entry
 + The subspace bank forecloses some important building or structure,
   requiring you to break into their vault to get the key and reopen
   it (Hero's Crystal)
 + Diving into the warehouse island water with scuba suit will result
   in an underwater merfolk cavern
 + The mechanic is missing his Golden Wrench, which is (probably) in
   the undersea kingdom. With it, he can repair the player's broken
   objects
 + Steve's Smash-a-Lock (only open in the past), where you can have
   Steve break open the vault lock to get Atheena's crystal back.
   Also, Steve may give you a Suspicious Briefcase that you must
   deliver to present-day Steve in the prison.
 + Evil flame spirit appears in the fire pits after N visits. After
   appeasing him by giving him something, ... I dunno, something
   happens ... (Necromancy Certificate? Joe?)
 + The Ancient Minister will tell you how you ended up in subspace
   (mainly to help the player understand). If the player has no record
   of entering subspace in any "standard" way, then his heart will be
   pure and the Minister will speak to him more frankly, and then....
   something.... (the record of entering subspace can be cleared with
   Dr. Cipher's help)
 + Science Johnson controls the console room. His soul is in the abyss
   area and needs to be rescued, but once it is, he will end up
   outside the door to the controls in the console room and explain
   the goal of the game to the player, as well as possibly give him
   hints once he has X muffins.
 + Crispy Joe's Sandwich Shop...? (Prehistory?)
 + Prehistory contains a grocery store with a labyrinth underneath it.
   At the base of the labyrinth (explorable by subspace map? what if
   the subspace map is just a special map that works in subspace,
   labyrinth, and shrunk ventilation and its not specific to
   subspace?) there is a jungle dome with a passcode to get in
 + The Reaper calls in the player's favor. Possibly to help retrieve a
   stolen item from the Ancient Minister (do they have a rivalry or
   something?).
 + Attorney-Man's reward?
 + If the Reaper has both the Black Olive and the Necromancy
   Certificate, then what if he only gives the player one of the two
   (player gets to choose) then requires a quest for the other? /////
 + The True Reaper is sealed away in the Ancient Minister's temple?
   Sealed away in a chest that only Steve's Smash-a-Lock can help
   with?
 + The Black Olive needs to do something (double subspace???)
 + Heart Room in the past does something? (possibly just an easter
   egg; exit blocked off?)
** Implemented
 + Turn-based RPG-style combat for Joe and Merchant-bot
 + Hunter, inmate, and second prison guard souls for Johnny Death
 + Attorney-Man and the three clients (player, guard, and robber)
 + The stolen luggage will let you hide in the cargo hold of the dream
   train to make it back to the dream world
 + Trade in the fireproof suit for a scuba suit (and vice versa) with
   Todd
 + Dr. Cipher wants his Necromancy Certificate back from Joe. Is Joe
   secretly a supervillain who wants to use the Certificate to rule
   the world? If so, the player probably has to go call on Atheena to
   save the world from him. One of the rewards from defeating Joe, in
   addition to a Black Olive stolen from the Taco Man, is that the
   portal to the underworld will remain open, providing a one-way path
   into a new part of the underworld, filled with dark souls and evil
   magic. Perhaps the Certificate is torn? You have to get it
   repaired?
 + Too easy to get to Underworld Mystery Room? Consider changing the
   past button to do something else.
** Discarded
 + Shrinking item but requires certain power port (purple outlets) to
   use
 + On the opposite side of the narrow tunnel in the Underworld
   (accessible with shrinking item), you can access the secret
   elevator which goes to the warehouse island

* MISCELLANEOUS
