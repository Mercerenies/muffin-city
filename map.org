* STATES / EVENTS

** Events
*** Robbery Event (~city-thug~)
**** no
     After the first visit to the Shady Alley, the player will be told
     that someone is watching them. The game proceeds to state
     ~stalking~.
**** stalking
     If he goes to the police station, he will have the option of
     telling the police he is being followed, resulting in state
     ~chasing~. If the player goes to the shopping or hotel districts,
     then the robber leaps out and strikes, pointing a gun in the
     player's face and demanding money. The player can cooperate (if
     they actually have money), refuse, or claim to have none.
      - Cooperate - The player gives up either a silver coin or a
        platinum credit card and the robber runs off. The game moves
        to state ~island~.
      - Claim (truthfully) - If the player truthfully has no money,
        the robber will let him go and return to state ~no~.
      - Claim (falsely) - The robber will call the player on his lie
        and act as though he refused.
      - Refuse - The player will be shot and will go to Underworld.
        The robber will go hide out on Dream Train to avoid the
        police. Move to state ~hiding~.
**** chasing
     The robber will keep a low profile and will not be able to be
     found. In this state, the Shady Alley will reveal a Silver Coin.
     If the Shady Alley coin has been collected (~sa-coin~) and the
     player goes to the Underworld hub, then the game moves to ~no~.
**** island
     The robber will end up on the Warehouse island. The player can
     talk to him. The robber will say that he ended up not needing the
     player's money and will return whatever he stole (~stolen-good~).
     He will then leave and the game will revert to ~no~.
     Alternatively, telling the police will result in the `hunted`
     state. If the player approaches the Warehouse island while
     Attorney-Man is also serving justice there (~attorney-man~ in
     state ~fed~ or above), Attorney-Man will automatically chastise
     him, sending the game back to ~no~ and returning the stolen item.
**** hiding
     The robber will be on the Dream Train. The player can talk to
     him, where he will apologize for shooting the player and claim
     that it was "just business". The game then moves to ~no~ as the
     robber leaves the train. Alternatively, if the player pulls the
     emergency brake, the robber will run off into the moonscape, and
     the game will move to ~no~.

     //// What then?
**** hunted
     The robber will be caught and moved to the dining hall in the
     prison. If the player talks to him, the game moves to ~caught~.
**** caught
      If the player talks to the police (with a clean criminal record,
      according to the Trial Event), they will present him with the
      stolen good he lost. If the Platinum Card has not been obtained
      (~thug-card~), they will also present him with that, and he will
      be asked to choose which one was his. After doing so, the game
      reverts to ~no~.
*** Trial Event (~trial-crime~)
**** no
     The player has not been arrested. When the player is arrested for
     confessing to murder, the game will go to state ~court~,
     trial-reason will go to state ~murder~, and the player is moved
     to the courtroom, where the trial will proceed. If the player
     should end up in prison in this state, he can speak to the
     warden, who will promptly release him with an apology.

     //// Warden stuff is not in the game right now
**** court
     The player is given the option to plead guilty or innocent. If he
     pleads guilty, he is convicted. If he pleads innocent and lacks a
     lawyer, he will be convicted anyway. In the case of conviction,
     the game moves to ~prison~ and the player is moved to prison.
     Once again, if the player ends up in prison, the warden will
     happily release him. Alternatively, he can use Dr. Cipher in the
     Underworld to reset this state to ~no~.

     If the player has a lawyer, he will escape the trial. However, he
     will be captured on sight by the police and taken back to the
     courtroom.
**** prison
     In this state, if the player moves to the police station, he will
     be apprehended and tried in court, moving back to state ~court~.
     If the player visits Dr. Cipher, his Document Transmogrifier will
     reset this to ~no~.

     If the player has a lawyer, he will escape the trial. However, he
     will be captured on sight by the police and taken back to the
     courtroom.
*** Gate Guard Event (~prison-guard~)
**** no
     The prison guard stands at the gate. The player can talk to him
     and bribe the guard with a Silver Coin, releasing the player back
     to the city and moving to `paid`. Note that even though the
     player has been freed from prison, he does not have a clean
     record and will be arrested on sight if he returns to the police
     station.
**** paid
     If the player ends up in prison again, the guard will still be
     there. He will initially resist releasing the player but will
     relent when reminded of the bribe. The player is released and the
     game moves to `fired`.
**** fired
     The third time the player is in prison, there will be a female
     guard in place of the original guard. She will not be amenable to
     bribes and will not release the player. When the player speaks to
     her, the game moves to `search`.
**** search
     The mustached guard is sitting in the corner of the dream world
     airport. The player can speak to him, and he will complain about
     being fired. If Attorney-Man is accepting clients (attorney-man),
     then the player will have the option to tell the guard about
     Attorney-Man. If he does so, the attorney-guard flag will be set
     to `okay`. In this state, when the player arrives at the prison's
     gate, attorney-guard will be set to `seen` and the game will move
     to `cleared`.
**** cleared
     The guard is grateful to the player for helping him and will
     release him from prison whenever he wants. If the player asks the
     guard about Attorney-Man, attorney-guard will be set to `yes` and
     ~attorney-man~ will be updated to reflect the new client.
*** Johnny Death Event (~johnny-quest~)
**** no
     Johnny Death is in the Underworld balcony and is seeking souls
     for his display case. When the player encounters him, he will ask
     for help stealing souls for his display. If the player accepts,
     he will be given the Soul Crystal and the Elevator Access Key so
     that he can exit the Underworld. The game moves to `accepted`.
**** accepted
     Johnny is waiting to receive souls from the player. The souls
     that are available are in the prison exercise fields
     (exercise-soul), the subspace taco shop (guard-soul), and ...
     When the first soul is brought to him, Johnny will tell the
     player about Dr. Cipher's invention and the game will move to
     `1`.
**** 1
     Johnny is waiting to receive more souls. When the second soul is
     brought to him, Johnny will upgrade the player's Elevator Access
     Key into an Upgraded Elevator Access Key. The game will then move
     to `2`.
**** 2
     Johnny is waiting for one more soul. When the third and final
     soul is brought to him, Johnny will open all the doors in the
     lobby, giving the player access to all of the rooms. In
     particular, this opens the mercury room, which contains the Cream
     Cheese Muffin. The game also moves to `done` at this time.
**** done
     Johnny's collection is complete. If the player speaks to him, he
     will simply thank the player.
*** The Butler's Event (~butler-game~)
**** no
     The butler is nowhere to be found. The game will move from this
     state to ~cell~ when the following three conditions are met.
      - The player has just been arrested and moved to the prison.
      - The player has been arrested before (~been-to-prison~).
      - The player has at least one item.
**** cell
     The butler is in the player's prison cell. When he talks to him,
     he will tell the player about the science lab and how to get to
     it. The game then moves to ~cell1~.
**** cell1
     The game will move from this state to ~pawn~ when the following
     three conditions are met.
      - The player has just entered the pawn shop in the present.
      - The player has talked to Dr. Louis (~talked-to-louis~).
      - The player has jumped into the fire pits (~jumped-into-fire~).
**** pawn
     The butler is in the pawn shop in the present. When he talks to
     him, he will give the player a Fireproof Suit. The game then
     moves to ~pawn1~.
**** pawn1
     The game will move from this state to ~shabby~ when the
     following conditions are met.
      - The player has just entered Shabby Jack's in the past.
      - The player has the Soul Crystal.
      - The player has read the note on the warehouse wall
        (~merchant-war~ is not ~no~).
      - The player has initiated discussion with Attorney-Man on the
        island (~attorney-man~ is ~talked1~ or beyond).
**** shabby
     The butler is in Shabby Jack's in the past. When the player talks
     to him, he will give the player a Crystal Ball. The game then
     moves to ~shabby1~.
**** shabby1
     //// Next state
*** Attorney-Man's Career (~attorney-man~)
**** no
     Attorney-Man has not been spoken to, so he will only appear in
     Shabby Jack's in the past. After he introduces himself, the
     player can encourage him or walk away. In the first case, the
     game moves to `talked`. In the second case, it moves to `met`.
**** met
     The player has spoken to Attorney-Man. If he speaks to him again,
     the same options as in `no` will be presented. If the player
     walks away, nothing happens. If the player encourages him, the
     game moves to `talked`.
**** talked
     Attorney-Man in the past will say simply that he will embark on a
     journey soon. In the present, Attorney-Man appears on the
     northern side of the warehouse island. When spoken to, he will
     ask for a taco and the game will move to `talked1`.
**** talked1
     Attorney-Man in the past will continue saying he will embark
     soon. In the present, Attorney-Man remains on the warehouse
     island and continues asking for food. If the player has given the
     Taco Man an olive (~taco-shop~ is ~olive~ or ~fed~), then the
     player can request a taco from the Taco Man. Delivering this taco
     to Attorney-Man moves to the game to `fed`.
**** fed
     In this state, Attorney-Man will wait for cases. The player can
     deliver his own case (attorney-self), the robber's case
     (attorney-thug), and the prison guard's case (attorney-guard).
     Each of these moves the game forward, first into `1`, then `2`,
     then `done`.
**** 1
     See `fed`.
**** 2
     See `fed`.
**** done
     ////
**** complete
     ////
*** The Taco Shop (~taco-shop~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to the taco shop manager. When he does
     so, the game moves to `spoken` or to `olive` if the player has an
     olive. Joe the Time-Traveler will be in the subspace hub and will
     simply complain about hunger.
**** spoken
     The player has spoken to the taco shop manager but has not
     presented him with an olive. The taco shop manager will be
     looking for an olive. When presented with one, the game will move
     to `olive`. Joe the Time-Traveler will still complain about
     hunger.
**** olive
     The player has presented the taco shop manager with an olive. If
     the player talks to Joe the Time-Traveler, the game will move to
     ~fed~ and Joe will move to the taco shop.
**** fed
     Joe the Time-Traveler will, upon being asked, tell the player
     about the secret password to the pawn shop in the past. The game
     will remember that he has done so (~pawn-shop-pass~). After
     completing the bulk of the ~necro-cipher~ quest, the player will
     have the opportunity to acquire the Taco Man's missing Black
     Olive. When the player returns the Black Olive to him, the game
     moves to ~doubled~.
**** doubled
     The player has delivered the Black Olive to the Taco Man.
*** The Hunter's Adventure (~hunter-trail~)
**** no
     The player has not visited the forest outside the prison yet. The
     Hunter is at Shabby Jack's and will simply say he is looking for
     a good forest to hunt in. When the player visits the forest, the
     game will move to `visited`.
**** visited
     The player has visited the forest but not told the Hunter about
     it. When the player tells the Hunter, who is still at Shabby
     Jack's, about it, the game will move to `forest` and the Hunter
     will move to the forest.
**** forest
     The Hunter is in the forest. When the player speaks to him here,
     the player will have the option of suggesting that the Hunter go
     to the cave. If he does so, the game will move to `under` and the
     Hunter will move to the Underworld.
**** under
     The Hunter is in the Underworld.
*** Trip to Subspace (~subspace-reason~)
**** no
     The player has not been sent to subspace yet. If the player ends
     up in subspace in this state, he has done so without causing a
     paradox or otherwise. When the player is sent to subspace,
     depending on the reason, the game will move to `arrest`.
**** arrest
     The player was sent to subspace as a result of confessing to a
     crime in the past. This implies that the player had an unclean
     criminal record at the start of the present day, which
     contradicts the order of events.
**** button
     The player caused the time machine (which did not work yet) to
     explode in the past, making it impossible that he operate it in
     the present.
*** Evil Flame Spirit (~fire-pit~)
**** no
     The player has not begun to approach the evil flame spirit. When
     the player visits the fire pits with the Fireproof Suit, the game
     will move to `odd`.
**** odd
     The player has been to the fire pits successfully once. When the
     player visits the starting area of the big city, the game will
     move to `even`.
**** even
     The player has been to the pits and back once.

     //// Player must have at least two science keys

     ////
**** talked
     ////
*** The Necromancy Certificate (~necro-cipher~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to Dr. Cipher about his Necromancy
     Certificate yet. If the player talks to Dr. Cipher after the
     Butler's second event (~butler-game~ is ~pawn1~ or beyond) and
     after using the pawn shop password (~pawn-shop-pass~ is ~yes~),
     Dr. Cipher will seem mildly alarmed by something. If the player
     asks what is wrong, Dr. Cipher will explain that his Necromancy
     Certificate has been stolen. The game will then proceed to
     `spoken`.
**** spoken
     The player has been sent to look for the Necromancy Certificate.
     Joe the Time-Traveler will have it at the taco shop in subspace.
     When the player approaches him, Joe will insist that it is a
     family heirloom, not a cursed artifact. If the player presses
     him, he will not give, but the game will move to `found`.
**** found
     The player has found the Certificate, but Joe will not give it
     up. The player must return to Dr. Cipher and share his findings.
     When the player tells Dr. Cipher, he will confirm that Joe's
     scroll is in fact the Certificate and tell the player to claim
     the Certificate at all costs. The game will move to `encouraged`.
**** encouraged
     Having been reassured that Joe definitely has the Certificate,
     the player must confront Joe again. When he does so, Joe will
     confess to stealing the Certificate but will claim that Dr.
     Cipher is the villain. The player has the option of buying into
     his story, but it doesn't matter, because either way, Joe will
     decide that the player knows too much. Joe activates the
     Necromancy Certificate and the game moves to `rising`.
**** rising
     Joe has activated the Certificate and is summoning the spirits of
     the dead. The player has the option to fight him then and there.
     If he does so, the player will enter one-on-one turn-based combat
     with Joe, who will proceed to summarily curbstomp him, sending
     the player to the underworld. Instead, if the player visits
     Atheena the Hero, she will offer to help in the fight against
     Joe, moving the game to `help`.
**** help
     Atheena is at the taco shop waiting to confront Joe with the
     player. The battle will now go much more smoothly, and the player
     and Atheena will win. Joe will be banished to the underworld,
     where Dr. Cipher will see that justice is served. The Necromancy
     Certificate falls into a void which leads to the abyss. Atheena
     will return to the portal room. The game moves to `beaten`.
**** beaten
     Joe has been defeated, but the Certificate has not been
     recovered. It has fallen into the hands of the Reaper in the
     abyss. When the player addresses the Reaper, he will offer the
     player either the Black Olive or the Necromancy Certificate. The
     player must choose one (~reaper-has-item~) to take for free. The
     other item will become available after completing a quest for the
     Reaper. Upon choosing the first item, the game moves to `item`.
**** item
     The player has the option to give Dr. Cipher the Certificate, if
     he has it. If the player chose the Olive from the Reaper, he will
     have to wait until he completes the Reaper's quest to get the
     other. Regardless, once the player returns the Certificate, Dr.
     Cipher will give him the Heart Key and the game will move to
     `yes`.
**** yes
     Dr. Cipher has the Certificate, Joe has been captured, and the
     player has the Heart Key. Mission accomplished.
*** The Reaper's Desire (~reaper-helper~)
**** no
     The player has not done anything for the Reaper yet. When the
     player claims an item from the Reaper via ~necro-cipher~ in
     ~beaten~, the game moves to ~item~.
**** item
     The player has claimed one item from the Reaper, but the Reaper
     is not ready to give the player a quest. If the player asks for
     the other item in this state, the Reaper will decline to give it.
     After the player reenters the starting area of the game, the game
     moves to ~reset~.
**** reset
     The player has been back to the hub area. If the player has
     triggered the third butler event (~butler-game~ is ~shabby1~ or
     beyond) and the game is in this state when he talks to the
     Reaper, then he will offer a quest based around reclaiming an
     item from the Ancient Minister. Upon accepting the quest, the
     game moves to ~accepted~ and the player receives the Reaper's
     blessing (~reaper-blessing~).
**** accepted
     The player has accepted the Reaper's quest. Now, if he attempts
     to take the Cursed Chest from the subspace temple, he will
     succeed. The Cursed Chest is locked, so the Reaper will not
     accept it in its current state. Instead, the player must take the
     Cursed Chest to Steve's. Steve will agree to open the chest in
     exchange for the player holding onto the Suspicious Briefcase for
     her. At that time, the game will move to ~locksmith~.
**** locksmith
     Steve hasn't gotten around to working on the Cursed Chest yet.
     When the player leaves the locksmith's shop, she will get around
     to it, so the game will move to ~locksmith1~ and
     ~steve-disappeared~ will move to ~gone~.
**** locksmith1
     Steve has disappeared and is completely inaccessible for the
     moment. If the player speaks to the Reaper, he will refer him to
     Johnny. Johnny can bring Steve back in the Other Room
     (~steve-disappeared~ moves to ~resurrected~). At any point in
     this state, the player can take the chest back from Steve's shop
     in the past. After the player talks to Steve in the Other Room,
     the game moves to ~locksmith2~.
**** locksmith2
     The player has spoken to Steve in the underworld. The game will
     remain in this state until he delivers the Cursed Chest to Steve,
     at which time the previous Reaper will be released. The previous
     Reaper will thank the player and fade back toward the abyss,
     leaving Steve understandably confused. At this time, the game
     moves to ~recovered~.
**** recovered
     The two Reapers have merged. If the player visits them, they will
     thank him and offer the item as promised. ~reaper-has-item~ will
     move to ~0~ and the game will move to ~yes~.
*** The Captain's Anchor (~captain-boat~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to the captain yet. The captain will
     not appear until the second Butler event. When the player speaks
     to him, the captain will mention that his ship is missing its
     wheel, and the game will move to ~spoken~.
**** spoken
     The captain has asked the player for a wheel and hinted rather
     heavily that the Pawnbroker may have one. If the player visits
     the Pawnbroker in the present, he will say he doesn't have one
     and that he wishes the player had requested the item earlier that
     day. If the player visits the Pawnbroker in the past, he can make
     a request for the wheel, and the game will move to ~requested~ at
     that time.
**** requested
     The player has requested the wheel. The Pawnbroker in the present
     will have the item available. It costs the player one Silver Coin
     to purchase, and upon buying it, the player receives the Ship's
     Wheel and the game moves to ~obtained~.
**** obtained
     The player has the Ship's Wheel and must deliver it to the
     captain. Upon delivering it, the game moves to ~yes~.
**** yes
     The captain has the Ship's Wheel and will allow the player to
     board his ship freely.
*** Unfinished Business (~motel-ghost~)
**** no
     The motel ghost is invisible. The player cannot encounter him in
     this state. When the player first visits the floor of the Abyss
     containing the Reaper, the game moves to `visited`.
**** visited
     The player can now see the ghost. If the player talks to him, he
     will want to tell his story. After hearing his story, the game
     will move to `motel`.
**** motel
     The player can tell the ghost where he is "meant" to go. He can
     send him to the prison (`prison`), the island (`warehouse`), or
     subspace (`subspace`). In any case, the game will move to the
     respective state. The ghost will not go to a location in which he
     has already completed his business (respectively, motel-prison,
     motel-warehouse, and motel-subspace).
**** prison
     ////
**** subspace
     ////
**** warehouse
     ////
**** yes
     ////
*** The Great Robot War (~merchant-war~)
**** no
     The player has not initiated the Merchant-bot quest. In this
     state, if the player visits the east side of the warehouse
     island, he will see a message scribbled into the warehouse wall,
     begging for help for an unknown author against an oppressive
     mastermind. Upon reading this note, the game moves to ~noted~.
**** noted
     The player can now notice the large tree in the forest and
     examine it. However, the player must have the Shovel to continue
     on this quest. If the player digs around the tree with the
     Shovel, he will get the Rusty Warehouse Key and the game will
     move to ~warehouse~.
**** warehouse
     The player has obtained the Rusty Warehouse Key. He needs to use
     it to unlock the warehouse front door. When he does so, the game
     moves to ~unlocked~.
**** unlocked
     The player needs to investigate the rest of the warehouse. In the
     back, he will find a Cryptic Note that he can't decipher. Upon
     taking the note, the game moves to ~crypto~.
**** crypto
     From here, the player needs to take the Cryptic Note to Arthur
     Miles of ~crypto-king~. Upon delivering the note, the game moves
     to ~crypto1~.
**** crypto1
     The player has given the Cryptic Note to Arthur. In this state,
     Arthur has not deciphered it yet. When the player enters the
     starting hub area of the map, the game moves to ~deciphered~.
**** deciphered
     The note has been deciphered. When the player talks to Arthur, he
     will immediately read the deciphered note, moving the game to
     ~chip~. //// Does Merchant-bot go to the underworld when he dies?
**** chip
     ////
**** yes
     ////
*** The Talking Fence (~the-fence~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to the sentient Fence in the prison
     yard yet. When the player attempts to climb over the Fence, it
     will interrupt him. The Fence will then proceed to explain its
     goal of building something and ask the player for a paperclip.
     The game moves to ~paperclip~.
**** paperclip
     The Fence wants a paperclip. If the player offers the Brass
     Paperclip, the Fence will take it and the game will move to
     ~paperclip1~.
**** paperclip1
     The Fence has the paperclip. When the player enters the north
     prison hallway, the game moves to ~shovel~.
**** shovel
     ////
**** shovel1
     ////
*** Spirit of the Cottage (~cottage-spirit~)
**** no
     The cottage quest has not been initiated. Silver Starlight is not
     yet at the cottage. When the player arrives at the cottage, the
     family will be around, generally doing housework. The player
     needs to talk to the man of the house to advance the game to
     ~evil~.
**** evil
     The player has spoken to the owner of the cottage, but nothing
     has happened yet. If the player visits the starting area and the
     first Butler event has occured (~butler-game~ is ~cell1~ or
     above), the game will move to ~starlight~.
**** starlight
     When the player returns to the cottage, the family will be
     huddled together at the house. In the shed, Silver Starlight will
     be searching for evil spirits. When the player talks to her, she
     will go through a lengthy introduction and then explain that she
     is tracing a source of evil but lost her magic scepter. She is
     trying to build a new scepter, but she needs a crystal ball to do
     it. When the player agrees to find a crystal ball for her, the
     game will move to ~starlight1~.
**** starlight1
     After the player obtains the Crystal Ball from the Butler, the
     player can offer to give the Crystal Ball to Starlight. Upon
     doing so, she will open a portal to the pocket dimension the
     spirits are hiding in, and the game will move to ~pocket~.
**** pocket
     The pocket dimension is open. This is the state the game will
     remain in as long as the spirits have not been completely
     defeated. ~false-stage~ will detail the player's current progress
     in the simulation world.

*** The Pirate Raid (~pirate-attack~)
**** no
     The pirates have not raided yet and will not be seen. After the
     player rides the dream ship to the warehouse island, the game
     will move to ~ready~.
**** ready
     The pirates have not raided yet but will raid next time. The
     pirates will only raid when the captain's ship leaves from the
     dream port, and the ship will return to the dream port after the
     raid. Once the pirates have attacked once, the game moves to
     ~attacked~.
**** attacked
     The pirates have attacked. They will continue to do so anytime
     the player sets sail. The Captain (of the dream ship) will warn
     him of this, and will tell him he needs to go find a pirate
     disguise to fool them. When the Captain gives him this
     information, the game moves to ~hat~.
**** hat
     The player needs to find a pirate costume. If he talks to the
     pawnbroker, he'll point him toward the Hatman. Upon being asked,
     the Hatman will want a cowboy hat in return, and the game will
     move to ~hat1~.
**** hat1
     The Hatman wants a cowboy hat. The player can only get it from
     the hunter. The hunter won't give it up as long as he has a soul.
     Once the player obtains the Cowboy Hat, the game moves to ~hat2~.
**** hat2
     The player has obtained the Cowboy Hat and must deliver it to the
     Hatman. When he does so, the game moves to ~disguised~.
**** disguised
     The player has the Pirate Hat but has not yet used it. The player
     must encounter the pirates using the captain's ship as before.
     This time, if the player dons the Pirate Hat and speaks
     correctly, the pirates will accept him and the game will move to
     ~yes~.
**** yes
     The player has befriended the pirates. They will no longer
     attack. Additionally, when the player speaks to the captain,
     there will be an additional destination option, allowing the
     player to visit the pirate ship anytime.
*** Just a Toy (~baby-doll~)
**** no
     The player has not encountered the sentient baby doll yet. The
     doll is in the refrigerator of the hut basement in the city. When
     the player opens the fridge, the doll will be there. If the
     player takes the doll, she will wake up and run off. The game
     then moves to ~running~.
**** running
     The baby doll is in the vacant room in the underworld. When the
     player encounters her, a cutscene occurs. If Steve has not
     occupied the room yet, the baby doll will simply run away and the
     game will move to ~forest~.

     //// And if she has?
**** forest
     The baby doll is by the cottage in the forest. When the player
     encounters her (in the main cottage yard area), a cutscene
     occurs. If the farmer is out, he will panic, but nothing of
     interest will occur. If not, then Starlight will attack the doll,
     chasing her off and causing her to drop the Diamond Key. In
     either case, the game moves to ~outer~. If the doll drops the
     Diamond Key, then ~doll-key~ moves to ~yes~.
**** outer
     ////
*** The Moth King (~moth-king~)
**** no
     The player has not met Mothka yet. Upon meeting Mothka in the
     past in the Heart Room, the game moves to ~met~ and Mothka kills
     the player to prove a point.
**** met
     The player has met Mothka. When he returns to the past in the
     Heart Room, Mothka will begin to respect the player for evading
     death. He will then challenge him to a game of chess. Mothka
     demands that the player meet him in the mime's basement in twelve
     hours' time. The game moves to ~challenged~.
**** challenged
     If the player approaches Mothka in the past, he will simply
     gloat. The player must confront Mothka in the present. ////
*** Brainwashed (~brain-control~)
**** no
     The Mastermind quest has not started yet. The player cannot find
     the Mastermind anywhere. In this state, Mister Midas is in the
     prison cafeteria, already hypnotized. In order for the Mastermind
     quest to start, the player must have satisfied several criteria.
     + The player must be entering the prison washroom.
     + The washroom coin muqt have already been collected
       (~washroom-coin~ is ~yes~).
     + Harry must already have escaped (~harry-location~ is ~freedom~
       or beyond).
     In this case, the game moves to ~initiated~.
**** initiated

     enters the underworld lobby, the game moves to ~washroom~.
**** washroom
     Mister Midas is now in the prison washroom for his hypnosis
     session. When the player talks to Mister Midas, he only spouts
     gibberish once again, but the game moves to ~washroom1~.
**** washroom1
     Mister Midas is still in the prison washroom. When the player
     tries to leave the washroom, the Mastermind will confront him and
     try to hypnotize him. When that fails, he will order Mister Midas
     to kill him. The game then moves to ~hiding~.
**** hiding

*** Cryptography (~crypto-king~)
**** no

     dream train in any cabin, the game moves to ~ready~.
**** ready

     the Ritzy Inn main room, Arthur will storm in and check into his
     room. When this happens, the game moves to ~met~.
**** met
     In this state, the player can ask Carl who Arthur is. After Carl
     explains this, the game moves to ~met1~.
**** met1
     The player can go upstairs and talk to Arthur. In order to get
     into his room, the player needs the Cryptic Note from
     ~merchant-war~. After the player successfully convinces Arthur to

* NOTES

** ACCEPTED Cave and Lantern
   Cave will lead somewhere cool if you have a light (inverse city)
** ACCEPTED False Imprisonment
   Given gift if falsely imprisoned (according to Warden), maybe
   Religious Artifact
** DONE Pirates
 + Pirates will eventually attack the dream ship, and if you raid them
   you'll get a Religious Artifact
 + After N uses of the dream ship (probably N=2), pirates attack. If
   you don't have the pirate hat, they kill you. If you do, they think
   you're one of them and give you access to their ship.
 + You get the pirate hat by trading with the Hatman. He wants the
   cowboy hat from the hunter, which you can only get after you take
   his soul.
** DONE Fire Pits
   Past the fire pits, there should be multiple rooms which are
   accessible, not just the freight elevator
** DONE Shop Prices
   Merchant-bot has two items (one at a ridiculous price); there is a
   quest to kill him, which leads to the warehouse office. At that
   time, Merchant-bot 2 takes over and sells the expensive one for
   less
** ACCEPTED Pawnbroker's Items
   Going to the past and requesting an item from the pawnbroker will
   result in that item being available the next day
   + Ship's Wheel
** DONE The Merchant War
 + Todd wants to rebel against Merchant-bot and leaves clues to help
   you do so
 + So to start with, you see Todd's writing on the warehouse wall. It
   leads you to the forest tree, which you dig around using the Shovel
   obtained from the Fence. This gives you the key to... (Warehouse or
   shop). This could go a couple of different ways.
   - *Original Plan* - The key lets you go to the shop, where you try
     unsuccessfully to unplug Merchant-bot. He attacks you, you flee
     and encounter Todd, who explains his plan. Then you go to the
     warehouse and land on top by means of the dream train (maybe need
     to collect a parachute for this). Then you go into the warehouse
     looking for clues, and on the way out Merchant-bot attacks,
     leading to the battle that you win with the Hero's Blade you'll
     borrow from Atheena.
   - *On the Other Hand* - Maybe the key leads to the warehouse. You
     go into the warehouse, find some clues about some collectible
     mcguffins that defeat Merchant-bot, and then get attacked. The
     warehouse is inaccessible now, as Merchant-bot changed the lock.
     So you have to collect the mcguffins (scattered around randomly)
     and then get back to the warehouse by landing on top (again, by
     the train and maybe a parachute) to plug in all of the mcguffins
     that destroy Merchant-bot.
 + The final battle could involve both Atheena and Starlight. Going in
   with only one of them will result in defeat.
   - Atheena won't be able to get close to Merchant-bot to use her
     blade (I guess the robot has lasers for some reason?).
   - Starlight can fire projectiles and stun Merchant-bot but can't
     hold him at bay long enough to attach the device which disables
     him.
   - Together, Starlight can slow Merchant-bot down enough for Atheena
     to stun him, which allows the player to attach the device that
     defeats him.
 + The final version uses the second plan, involving the key leading
   directly to the warehouse. The player finds an encrypted message
   which, when decrypted, tells of a self-destruct chip which can be
   used to defeat Merchant-bot. The battle then proceeds as the above
   bullet might suggest.
** DONE Escaping the Prison
   Help someone escape from prison by creating a diversion on entry.
   + Harry the Arsonist.
** ACCEPTED Foreclosure
 + The subspace bank forecloses some important building or structure,
   requiring you to break into their vault to get the key and reopen
   it (Hero's Crystal)
 + So, thinking about having the item /not/ be the Hero's Crystal. It
   would make more sense if the bank foreclosed on the portal room
   long before Atheena got there.
 + When the player gets the item back, the bank's army of lions chase
   him and block off most areas.
   - Get killed, blocked off.
   - Elevator is blocked by a man who takes the item back.
   - Must go to the mystery room, then subspace, then forest, then
     take prison bus to get to Steve's locksmith shop.
 + Okay, so maybe the bank took the portal device's key (whatever
   we're calling it these days) from the /previous/ owner of the
   portal device, who is now (for whatever reason) in prison. You need
   to talk to him to get some information.
** DONE Scuba Suit
   Diving into the warehouse island water with scuba suit will result
   in an underwater merfolk cavern
** ACCEPTED The Golden Wrench
   The mechanic is missing his Golden Wrench, which is (probably) in
   the undersea kingdom. With it, he can repair the player's broken
   objects
** ACCEPTED The Locksmith's
   Steve's Smash-a-Lock (only open in the past), where you can have
   Steve break open the vault lock to get Atheena's crystal back.
   Also, Steve may give you a Suspicious Briefcase that you must
   deliver to present-day Steve in the prison.
** ACCEPTED The Flame Spirit
   Evil flame spirit appears in the fire pits after N visits. After
   appeasing him by giving him something, ... I dunno, something
   happens ... (Necromancy Certificate? Joe?)

   So not Joe, as we've already done that. Maybe after the events with
   the cottage? The evil flame spirit is awoken because his brethren
   were defeated?

   Waterproof fireball? Needed to fight the shark off the warehouse
   island coast?
** DONE The Minister's Record
   The Ancient Minister will tell you how you ended up in subspace
   (mainly to help the player understand). If the player has no record
   of entering subspace in any "standard" way, then his heart will be
   pure and the Minister will speak to him more frankly, and then....
   something.... (the record of entering subspace can be cleared with
   Dr. Cipher's help)
** ACCEPTED Science Johnson
   Science Johnson controls the console room. His soul is in the abyss
   area and needs to be rescued, but once it is, he will end up
   outside the door to the controls in the console room and explain
   the goal of the game to the player, as well as possibly give him
   hints once he has X muffins.
** ACCEPTED Crispy Joe
   Crispy Joe's Sandwich Shop...? (Prehistory?)
** CONSIDERING The Prehistoric Maze
   Prehistory contains a grocery store with a labyrinth underneath it.
   At the base of the labyrinth (explorable by subspace map? what if
   the subspace map is just a special map that works in subspace,
   labyrinth, and shrunk ventilation and its not specific to
   subspace?) there is a jungle dome with a passcode to get in
** DONE The Reaper's Favor
 + The Reaper calls in the player's favor. Possibly to help retrieve a
   stolen item from the Ancient Minister (do they have a rivalry or
   something?).
 + If the Reaper has both the Black Olive and the Necromancy
   Certificate, then what if he only gives the player one of the two
   (player gets to choose) then requires a quest for the other?
 + The True Reaper is sealed away in the Ancient Minister's temple?
   Sealed away in a chest that only Steve's Smash-a-Lock can help
   with?
 + Johnny Death's father is the True Reaper (previous to the current
   Reaper), sealed away by the Ancient Minister? //// (This hasn't
   been explicitly established)
** Missing Rewards, etc.
 + [ ] Attorney-Man's reward?
 + [ ] The Black Olive needs to do something (double subspace???)
 + [X] Heart Room in the past does something? (possibly just an easter
   egg; exit blocked off?)
   - The Heart Room in the past is now the source of Mothka.
 + [ ] Steve's Suspicious Briefcase doesn't do anything right now.
 + [ ] The Religious Artifact from the pirate ship does nothing. There
   will also likely be a second (third?) one somewhere.
 + [ ] Make sure the Mime doesn't disappear before you break the pipe
   in the past, as he's the only other way to get to that area until
   you break the pipe.
 + [ ] The pipe in the past that you expose should appear in some form
   in the present.
 + [ ] Trenchcoat Man's Business Card does nothing right now.
** CONSIDERING The Flaming Axe
 + The Flaming Axe of Doom was used by the First Reaper to carve out
   the Underworld before time itself. Possibly, we can visit this
   place before time itself by supercharging the prehistory time
   machine. Visiting prehistory and heading down to the Underworld
   will encounter maybe an earlier Reaper?
   - Or maybe just at the beginning of humanity? I think we've decided
     that the Reaper's underworld is local to earth and other planets
     have their own similar system.
 + Later, the Flaming Axe will show up again in the present day,
   destroying the boundary between the underworld hub and the abyss.
 + The Flaming Axe cannot be touched by the player. If he does so, bad
   things happen (where do you go if you're already dead?). He'll need
   some kind of protection.
** ACCEPTED Mothka's Challenge
 + Queen piece converter (for Mothka game?) (and just, ya know, Mothka
   in general)

   Mothka is in the heart room in the past. He wants to challenge you
   in the present to a game of chess.
** CONSIDERING The RAM
   ........The computer RAM, infinite strip? (in the console room, an
   isolated area?)
** DONE The Fence
   The... Fence... trading to get things, like the shovel.
** Possible Coins
 + [X] Prison sink: silver coin in pipes?
** CONSIDERING The Guardian of Time
   Could the Guardian of Time be chilling in Double Subspace reachable
   with the Black Olive?

   + Note that we may alternatively reach the Guardian during the
     destruction of the world by Atheena's old enemy, as that would be
     something the Guardian would be more deeply interested in.
** CONSIDERING The Twins
 + Twins: the mailman and the taxman. Taxman collects a silver coin at
   some point for tax purposes. Mailman... I dunno, delivers mail?
** DONE Turn-Based Combat
   Turn-based RPG-style combat for Joe and Merchant-bot
** DONE Johnny's Souls
   Hunter, inmate, and second prison guard souls for Johnny Death
** DONE The Three Clients
   Attorney-Man and the three clients (player, guard, and robber)
** DONE The Luggage
   The stolen luggage will let you hide in the cargo hold of the dream
   train to make it back to the dream world
** DONE Trading with Todd
   Trade in the fireproof suit for a scuba suit (and vice versa) with
   Todd
** DONE The Necromancy Certificate
   Dr. Cipher wants his Necromancy Certificate back from Joe. Is Joe
   secretly a supervillain who wants to use the Certificate to rule
   the world? If so, the player probably has to go call on Atheena to
   save the world from him. One of the rewards from defeating Joe, in
   addition to a Black Olive stolen from the Taco Man, is that the
   portal to the underworld will remain open, providing a one-way path
   into a new part of the underworld, filled with dark souls and evil
   magic. Perhaps the Certificate is torn? You have to get it
   repaired?
** DONE The Underworld Mystery Room
   Too easy to get to Underworld Mystery Room? Consider changing the
   past button to do something else. +(Currently impossible to get there)+
   + You can now get there thanks to Mothka
** CANCELED Shrinking Down
   - Note taken on [2018-10-12 Fri 11:21] \\
     Canceled; the shrinking item is no longer an item but a machine
     that can only be used in one place
   Shrinking item but requires certain power port (purple outlets) to
   use
** CANCELED The Elevator Behind the Tunnel
   - Note taken on [2018-10-12 Fri 11:20] \\
     Cancelled; the warehouse island elevator is behind the fire pits
     and the narrow tunnel leads to the abyss
   On the opposite side of the narrow tunnel in the Underworld
   (accessible with shrinking item), you can access the secret
   elevator which goes to the warehouse island

** ACCEPTED The Reverse Pawn Shop
   In the inverse city, there's a pawn shop owner who wants religious
   artifacts and will give you a muffin for them.
** ACCEPTED Merchant-bot's Friend
   Maybe after the war with Merchant-bot, his friend from the inverse
   world (another Merchant-bot, or some "inverse" version of
   Merchant-bot) wants to send a letter to him. Since the regular
   Merchant-bot is gone (in the underworld? idk. Either way, he won't
   talk to the player), you have to get the key from (present-day)
   Todd and go to the past to talk to past Merchant-bot at his shop.
   + The friend is the Robot King, who has taken over. In his own
     timeline, the Robot King was Merchant-bot 2.0, who took over the
     world and then got to know the regular world's Merchant-bot. He
     warned him about the government plan, allowing Merchant-bot (the
     first) to stay in control of his shop until the player shows up.
** DONE Bank Card
   Just a small thing. But you should be able to /attempt/ to pay
   Atheena's loan with the Platinum Card. It will fail, of course, but
   it should be an option.
** CONSIDERING Corporate
   Johnny Death mentions offhandedly something about a "corporate"
   office. Perhaps the underworld that we know of is just the earth
   underworld (or maybe this world's underworld) and there are others
   that the player may or may not eventually access. Then the
   corporate office is somewhere (in space? subspace?) and eventually
   the player will meet the corporate branch.
** CONSIDERING The Top Floor
   The top floor of the Ritzy Inn is where some sort of sinister
   government agency meets to have its meetings. They all have robots
   or something. Idk. Perhaps to get in you have to get a fake
   government ID (from Grigor?) and show it to Carl.
** CONSIDERING Fighting Mummies
   A secret underground room in the warehouse houses an Egyptian tomb
   with a bunch of mummies (or maybe skeletons) that will jump out at
   you. I don't know. This one's not /too/ well thought out yet.

   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What if the tomb is on the warehouse
   island, and you can get to the island in prehistory too (prehistory
   is pretty small right now, all things considered). In prehistory,
   things are a bit different. Maybe you have to appease the mummies
   while they're alive so that they don't attack you in the present.
** ACCEPTED The Evil Portal
   Okay, this one is going to be long. So there's a cottage in the
   woods reachable from the prison forest by... I haven't decided yet.
   Maybe it's something that happens automatically if you go there
   after a certain point in the game. Maybe you can get there some
   other way after the initial forest visit. I don't know.

   Anyway, in this mysterious cottage, you meet an as yet unnamed
   superhero girl who channels magic powers and is sensing a great
   evil force at the cottage. She'll be building a magic scepter (she
   lost her original one or something) over time, and if you visit her
   after awhile, she'll have completely built it up. She'll open a
   portal to an evil world. Upon the two of you entering, you'll find
   yourself in the audience of a dance show, and she'll be one of the
   performers, having lost her scepter again apparently. Some things
   will happen, and you'll find the true source of the evil. She'll
   reward you with something (maybe a limited form of the magic
   scepter?). You have to go back through the evil portal again
   (she'll happily play it out with you again) to get a hidden muffin
   in the area that can't be obtained when doing the main evil portal
   quest. Whew.

   Related: The cottage may have a wall that can be passed through
   (with some item) to get to the dream world airport.

   Also, the third Butler event will get you the Crystal Ball I think.

   So most of this quest is done. We still need the final victory
   condition and reward. We need to decide where the item you need is.
   I'm thinking /maybe/ in the prehistoric jungle, but that's also
   really late game, so I'm not sure if I want to put it off that
   long. We'll see.
** CANCELED The Crystal Ball
   - Note taken on [2018-11-04 Sun 13:06] \\
     Canceled; I want the Silver Starlight event to be fairly
     early-game (as in, you can definitely do it as soon as Butler 3
     happens, and it's not paywall locked). With those constraints,
     it's fairly difficult to come up with a nontrivial route to
     travel along
   For the third Butler event, he gives the Crystal Ball. But it has a
   rule. The Crystal Ball can't travel to the underworld with the
   player if he dies. So he has to find a route back which doesn't
   involve dying.
** ACCEPTED Steve's Later Fate
   After Steve gets taken by the curse of the True Reaper, the player
   will have to resurrect her with Johnny's help. After that, she'll
   be in the Other Room for a bit. Then she'll get her own room in the
   underworld next to Dr. Cipher's, where she'll run a new locksmith
   shop. ////

   When the lions chase the player down after the bank robbery, Steve
   will flee to a safe room in the Ritzy Inn, where the player will
   have to visit her to get the bank vault unlocked.
** ACCEPTED Harry the Arsonist
   + I don't really know what I'm planning here. Just might be cool to
     have him if we need someone who does something with fire.
   + It's possible he could play into the evil flame spirit in some
     way, given their obvious mutual fascination with fire.
   + Maybe Harry is the guy in prison who you need to help break out.
     After you break him out, he burns something down (the police
     district hut?)
** CONSIDERING The Alien Factory
   Alright, so this is sort of two different ideas that I think fit
   well together.

   Idea 1: A factory. Probably in space or on the moon. Some sort of
   sinister plot going on here. Maybe the aliens are in cahoots with
   the people on the top floor of the Ritzy Inn. Or maybe something
   else. I don't really know yet.

   Idea 2: A guy who locked himself into a room because he turns into
   a giant rock monster if he is exposed to the outside air. The room
   is filled with mirrors, as his reflection stops him from
   transforming. The player has to transform him (which cracks the
   mirror), lure him out of the room, and find another mirror. Then
   he'll turn back and the player can safely visit his room, where
   there's some useful item waiting.

   So, if we combine these two, we get a guy who locked himself in a
   room in the basement of a sinister factory (did the factory
   experiment on him?) to protect everyone from his monster form. As
   one task, the player has to get the item in the mirror room by
   luring the monster out. Separately, as another task, he has to get
   to the bottom of the factory's evil intentions.
** CONSIDERING Shark Attack
   So, there's this empty area between the warehouse docks and the
   merfolk kingdom. If you wander around there blindly, a shark will
   find you and chase you, giving us another opportunity for a
   dynamic, resettable interaction like that of the thug.

   1. You wander around underwater. Shark appears. Your options are to
      swim up, swim down, or swim toward the shark. Guess which of
      these options is a bad idea.
      - Swim up (3)
      - Swim down (6)
      - Swim toward (2)

   2. You... swim toward the shark. Eaten alive. Have fun with that.
      Instant death.

   3. The shark chases you and finds itself beached. Probably will get
      a fun panicked reaction out of the captain if he's there. The
      shark will remain beached.
      - Shove him back into the water (4)
      - Shrink down (5)

   4. Shoving him back into the water resets the state. Go to (1).

   5. By going back and using the shrink machine while the shark is
      beached, you can get back to the warehouse island (it's /not/
      easy; you have to have fireproof suit and travel through
      underworld which will probably be hard to get to). You can go
      inside the shark, which... I don't know. Something cool happens
      here, I guess. Then afterward we go back to (3).

   6. You swim into the kingdom. The gatekeeper panics and closes the
      gate, locking the shark out. She won't reopen the gate for you
      (for obvious reasons). For this to work, there needs to be some
      other way out of the kingdom, probably a bed. You can ask the
      gatekeeper, and she'll tell you the shark is terrified of fire.
      - Exit the kingdom (7)
      - Use the fireball you got from probably the flame spirit (8)

   7. Reset. The shark goes away. Everyone's happy. Go to (1).

   8. You chase the shark away. You're a hero. Congratulations. The
      castle gates are now open to you. A new area to explore, some
      new characters, fun stuff. Go to 1.

** CONSIDERING The Resistance
   To fight the sinister government agents (probably those in the
   Ritzy Inn), a resistance has been formed. Their secret base, for
   safety reasons, exists in the dream plane. With a specific item,
   you can pass through the airport walls and find them. Initially,
   you'll encounter one of them somewhere else and that person will
   tell you how to get in.

   Maybe the secret place in the airport has another way out in the
   cottage? I don't know.

   Also, the members of the resistance got to know each other because
   they were all part of the same geology club / department. On paper,
   they still are, but they use those meetings to discuss the
   resistance. That's why all of their codenames are themed after
   types of rocks.
** CONSIDERING The Best Tacos
  After the Taco Man has both of his olives, he can make the best
  tacos on the planet. People from all over the multiverse will come
  to his shop. The visitors will rotate out after the player has
  talked to them and then "reset" at the hub. Many of the visitors
  will be available in other areas of the game as well but will act
  more casually at the taco shop.

  Possible visitors
  + The Postman and the Taxman (together or separately?)
** CONSIDERING Cloud World
   A part of prehistory above the clouds. Maybe the space elevator
   hasn't made it to space yet, or maybe it's just a ladder.

   There are some cloud people there. They live on the clouds and,
   since they're made of clouds, they can walk around on them. If you
   try to enter their village, you'll just fall through the clouds.
   You need the Cloud Shoes. The Cloud Shoes have been lost for
   thousands of years and eventually fall out of the sky and hit
   Attorney-Man in the head. He will give them to you as a reward for
   his main quest.

   Once you have the Cloud Shoes, the cloud people will tell you of
   the prophecy that the cloud shoes will only show themselves to the
   chosen hero of legend, whom they believe to be you.

   For those of you following along at home, yes, that means the
   chosen hero of the cloud people is Attorney-Man.
** ACCEPTED Beneath the Police
   There's a small, suspicious hut in the police district next to the
   otherwise tall buildings. It belongs to a mysterious criminal (the
   Mime?).
   + The Mime is there in the past but ran away in the present for some reason.
   + Trapped in a literal glass box in the inverse world?
   + A refrigerator containing a sentient baby doll.
** ACCEPTED Sentient Baby Doll
   A chase scene? The doll keeps running away and you keep finding it.
   Eventually, it gives you some reward for persistence.

   How did the baby doll get in the fridge to begin with? Clearly, it
   did something bad in the past and the player locked it away. Maybe
   stole a car and chased a nurse? I know that sounds random but it
   makes sense in my head.

   + Ricardo the cop was pursuing the baby doll in the past? Somehow
     that got him caught up in the mime's web?
** CONSIDERING Traveling Circus
   That's what this game needs. It can go to a few different locations
   at different times, as you progress Butler events.
** ACCEPTED Tiny Layout
   So the layout of the tiny city. You'll spend most of the time in
   the ventilation (Grigory) and the sewers (Arachnarok).

   Present
   + The ventilation is available.
   + The sewers link the hut and the hotel. You'll meet Arachnarok.
   + Can enter from Dr. Cipher's lab.

   Past
   + The ventilation is sealed off for some reason (maybe it's just
     the vent is closed right now)
   + The sewers are sealed off from the hotel side but can be forcibly
     opened from the hut side.
   + Can enter from Dr. Cipher's lab or by threatening the mime.
** CONSIDERING Company Policy
   Chuck is an accountant at some corporation (probably some place we
   haven't seen yet). The player meets him (maybe?) at some point.
   Then later, on the ship, the player sees Chuck being deposited into
   the ocean by a large crane. Upon being rescued, Chuck claims that
   it is company policy to deposit fired employees into the ocean and
   asks to be put back. The captain refuses and takes him back to the
   dream world.

   Chuck is scared that he is going to get caught violating his
   contract and will go to jail. The player must find him a false ID
   so he can start a new life.

   Perhaps the robber has the false ID. Maybe it falls out of his
   pocket on the moon? Then the player takes that to Chuck who starts
   a new life, and can be useful in some later quest after meeting
   again by chance.
** CONSIDERING Obsessed
   All of this happens after ~necro-cipher~ is done (and likely some
   other stuff).

   So there's this guy named Billy. You first encounter him in a
   common area, maybe even the central hub area. He has no idea how he
   got there. Then, shortly after, he's murdered by a woman. Later,
   you find him in the same spot, no memory once again. You can tell
   him to run to different locations to escape the murder. In each
   location, the woman will find him and kill him. Something unique
   may happen at each location depending on where it is.

   Later, you find out that the woman has stolen the Necromancy
   Certificate and is using it to repeatedly kill Billy. Not sure why.
   You need to get it back, after doing the miscellaneous side quest
   stuff relating to sending Billy to the various locations.

   What if this happens to Dr. Cipher's (or Joe's) Certificate in the
   inverse world, rather than having regular Dr. Cipher's Certificate
   stolen twice in rapid succession?
** CONSIDERING Star of the Show
   At some point, a major villain (potentially the wizard from
   Atheena's past) will harness the power of a distant star and try to
   use it to destroy the world. Likely, you will (of course) need
   Atheena's help to stop him.

   Surviving areas:
   + Inverse City (totally fine, actually)
   + Space (the areas not in our solar system)
   + Subspace
   + Console Room (but Science probably died in the heat death of earth)
   + Prehistory (but Crispy Joe doesn't exist anymore)
   + Dream World
   We need to make sure there's some way to get between these areas
   that doesn't visit an ignited area. Sleeping will get you to the
   dream train and then the dream world instantly, as the train won't
   go back to earth. Dying will... we'll have to think about that
   given that the underworld is exploded.

   Okay, second draft, and more thought out this time.

   At some point super late in the game, the player goes to some
   surviving area and finds that the ways back to the mortal world are
   gone. He visits Atheena, who has a hunch of what's going on.

   An evil wizard in medieval times harnessed the energy of a nearby
   star and used it to threaten the king. He gave the king one week to
   forfeit the throne to him or he would destroy the planet. The king
   sent his best warriors, including Atheena, to fight the wizard. The
   wizard killed most of the warriors and sent Atheena to subspace
   (maybe he doesn't kill women?). Then, one week later, he played his
   hand and destroyed the planet with that star. All of the
   present-day destinations (city, past city, prison, etc.) are gone,
   the underworld is gone, and the only areas that remain are those
   outside of time or sufficiently far from earth. Additionally,
   anyone originally from the present day (Science Johnson, Crispy
   Joe, the female prison guard) ceases to exist.

   Atheena somehow gets the player to the Guardian of Time, who
   stabilizes the player's existence as he would also be wiped out
   soon. Then the player has to navigate the six surviving areas of
   the map (five, really, because the console room won't do you any
   good) and create something to plant in prehistory which will
   activate and stop the wizard in a few thousand years.

   What caused things to play out differently the second time? Someone
   (maybe "One Word" guy) traveled back and changed things, knowing
   full well what he was doing.

   So just a random thought. How do we get to the Guardian of Time?
   Originally, I was thinking he owed Atheena a favor for something.
   But what if he's the third spicy food visit, and you have to have
   done the other two before getting there. Then the taco man cooks
   something to help you.
** CONSIDERING One Word
   A bad guy has discovered an ancient word which, if said in the
   right conditions, will destroy the planet instantly. You go back in
   time and enlist that bad guy's help in fighting him in the present
   day.

   [Ezekiel Morrow / Wordsmith]

   Before going back in time, he asks for history books from the
   player. The player cooperates, as he tells the player he is but a
   humble professor (which is admittedly true but not the whole truth).
   + One history book from the city
   + One history book from the prison, perhaps?
   + One history book from the parallel world
   + One history book from somewhere in space
** ACCEPTED Mind Control
   At some point early in the game (Butler 1, maybe), the player will
   meet an as yet unnamed evil mastermind. This mastermind has come up
   with an evil plan to take over the world. He invites the player to
   come visit him somewhere. When he does so, the mastermind will
   brainwash the player. From this point, the player's choices do not
   matter; he is led involuntarily to a confrontation that ultimately
   results in his death. The player goes to the underworld, and he is
   free of the mastermind's spell.

   The mastermind has left his usual hideout (wherever that was). Over
   the course of the next little while, the mastermind will kidnap and
   brainwash a handful of characters, who will stop performing their
   usual tasks and instead kill the player upon interaction (or maybe
   simply mutter gibberish). Eventually, the player will find the
   mastermind again, who will flee from him. The mastermind flees into
   the presidential ballroom in the Ritzy Inn, where he will collect
   all of his brainwash victims. If the player confronts him, the
   brainwash victims will win. The player will have to do something to
   get through the crowd (probably a special item).

   Once the player gets through the crowd, the mastermind will reveal
   his true plan: to brainwash the entire city and rule over it as
   dictator. I don't know exactly how the player is supposed to stop
   him from there. We'll have to think about it.
** ACCEPTED Delicious
   There could be four different foods in the game that are
   incredibly spicy.
   + Spicy Taco (made with Black Olive from Taco Man)
   + Spicy Chili (made by Dr. Cipher as thanks)
   + Spicy Burger (made by the train chef)
   + Spicy Soup (made by the hotel)

   Each time the player eats a spicy food, he's taken to a special
   part of subspace. There are four doors, and each time a new door
   opens. Behind each door is a special character.
   + First visit: The Man in the Trenchcoat
   + Second visit: The Postmaster
   + Third visit: The Source
   + Fourth visit: The Guardian of Time

   + The Guardian of Time (possibly only allowed during the One Word fiasco)?
   + The Postmaster (manages the Postman)?
   + The Source (magic sentient crystal that can unlock Starlight's true power)?
   + The Man in the Trenchcoat?
** CONSIDERING Headless
   After some time passes (at least after the Green Olive, maybe some
   more prereqs), a man without a head starts hanging out in the taco
   shop. The player needs to somehow find a way to communicate with
   him, so he can warn the player about his head, which is plotting to
   build a robotic mech suit and destroy the city.
** CONSIDERING Subspaces
   There are a lot of different subspaces, and the Minister exists in
   all of them. The Minister can transfer himself and others between
   the different ones. He also decides which subspace someone ends up
   in when they cause a paradox.
** ACCEPTED The Midas Touch
   A common criminal who calls himself Mister Midas after the
   mythological figure. Steals exclusively gold jewelry.

   Mister Midas is Mastermind's first victim, in the prison washroom. ////
** CONSIDERING Below the Bottom of the Sea
   What's below the bottom? I'm thinking that you can fire the pirate
   cannon and it will blow a hole in one of the merfolk homes. But
   where does that hole lead? The parallel world perhaps?
** CONSIDERING Twin Studies
   So we already know the aliens are experimenting on humans. How
   about this?

   Before the start of the game, two twins, June and Julie, are
   abducted by aliens. The aliens experiment for a bit and end up
   genetically enhancing the twins. June turns bright red and can fire
   lasers from her hands, and Julie turns bright green and can
   manipulate luck. The two used their newfound powers to escape and
   sought refuge back on earth. Unable to hide their new appearance,
   they kept to themselves and swore to never use their powers again.
   However, they do have the Oxygen Pocket Dimension that they stole
   from the aliens, and the player needs that to be able to leave the
   space prison in one piece. Perhaps one of the aliens in the prison
   knows of them and will point the player in the right direction.

   Meanwhile, in the second world, June and Julie went through a
   similar ordeal and swore off their powers at first. However, the
   Robot King took over and successfully hypnotized Julie, using her
   luck-based powers as a valuable asset. June went underground, began
   training with her abilities, and started (or joined?) a resistance
   movement against the Robot King.
** CONSIDERING No More Dreams
   We have the open question of what the dream world in the parallel
   dimension looks like. One option is to have there just be one dream
   world, and if you fall asleep in the other world, the train still
   takes you back to the /original/ starting point of the game.

   But here's an idea. What if someone or something destroyed the
   dream world intentionally (maybe the Robot King to get rid of the
   rebellion's hideout, maybe not). Then, whenever the player sleeps
   in the second world, he ends up in the nuked dream world, dies
   instantly, and wakes up in the mystery room of the (original)
   underworld. We'd have to explore what happened to the dream world,
   but I think it may be an interesting plot point.
** ACCEPTED Johnny Logic
   So, based on the way the quest went and the way Johnny has evolved
   as a character, I don't really like the "I want to collect souls"
   motivation for Johnny's initial quest. I like the quest, but the
   reasoning just makes him (and by extension, the player, for
   abetting) seem more evil than I intend.

   Here's my thought. A hellhound (or something like it, since we're
   not explicitly saying "hell" here) got loose and is hunting these
   three people (inmate, guard, hunter), maybe for something they
   haven't done yet, or maybe for something they did in a past life
   (turns out, reincarnation is a thing in this world?). Johnny needs
   to take their souls and put them somewhere safe. Then the player
   has to go and contain / kill the hellhound (killing it returns it
   to the underworld?), after which the souls are released.
** CONSIDERING Attorney-Man's Reward
   So, whether or not we accept this idea, Attorney-Man needs a
   reward. He literally has none right now.

   But here's a thought. Johnny gives you a reward every time you
   bring him a soul. So why can't Attorney-Man do the same every time
   you bring him a client?
   1. First client gets you the Evil Membership Card.
   2. Second client gets you Cloud Shoes (name tbd).
   3. Third client gets you ???
** CONSIDERING Evil Club
   A club in the underworld where all of the stereotypically "evil"
   professions get together and chat and have a good time.
   Attorney-Man got a membership card when he got his law degree, but
   he doesn't use it because he doesn't think he's evil. He gives it
   to you as a reward.

   "Evil" professions:
   - Lawyer (Attorney-Man)
   - Insurance Adjuster
   - CEO

** CONSIDERING First Time Visitor
   The train is a bit boring when you encounter it the first time. All
   it does it take you back to the hub. Odds are, you came from either
   the prison (in which case is functions as a prison break, at
   least), or Shabby Jack's (in which case you feel really cheated, as
   it does nothing for you). I say we have the first train visit give
   you a reward for being their customer. Something you can get really
   early-game, as it's very possibly the first thing a player will do.

   I would believe the train has a deal with the Ritzy Inn. What if
   the train conductor gives you a meal voucher to the Ritzy Inn?
** CONSIDERING The Sewer King
   King Arachnarok, the Spider King, rules over the sewers beneath the
   city. His son, Prince Arachnarok, is set to marry and take over the
   throne. Unfortunately, he has not found a significant other. His
   father kidnaps some poor human to to the Prince's groom. The King
   won't be reasoned with, so the player has to convince the Prince to
   help him free the human. They find a mannequin somewhere and put it
   in place of the human, and the wedding ceremony goes on as planned.

   Where does the player get the mannequin? Maybe in the other world,
   there's a shop that has them?

   What if the player needs the Postman's help to deliver the
   mannequin to the other world? Maybe he needs the Postmaster to talk
   to the Postman for him before he'll listen.
** CONSIDERING The Trenchcoat Man
   I don't really fully know what I want to do with him yet. He's
   likely to be the first spicy foods visit. But here are some ideas.
   + He gives you a business card that seems initially to serve no
     purpose. Later, Science Johnson will identify a tracker embedded
     into it and find out that the Trenchcoat Man is evil.
   + The Trenchcoat Man's business card is shady and will keep you out
     of some useful area (a bouncer or somebody will smell it on you
     and not let you in). You can try to throw away / shred it
     somewhere, but it will keep coming back. You need to find the
     Trenchcoat Man again, who will show you how to use it properly.
     Maybe he folds it into a paper crane?
