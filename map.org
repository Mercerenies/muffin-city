* STATES / EVENTS

** Events
*** Robbery Event (~city-thug~)
**** no
     After the first visit to the Shady Alley, the player will be told
     that someone is watching them. The game proceeds to state
     ~stalking~.
**** stalking
     If he goes to the police station, he will have the option of
     telling the police he is being followed, resulting in state
     ~chasing~. If the player goes to the shopping or hotel districts,
     then the robber leaps out and strikes, pointing a gun in the
     player's face and demanding money. The player can cooperate (if
     they actually have money), refuse, or claim to have none.
      - Cooperate - The player gives up either a silver coin or a
        platinum credit card and the robber runs off. The game moves
        to state ~island~.
      - Claim (truthfully) - If the player truthfully has no money,
        the robber will let him go and return to state ~no~.
      - Claim (falsely) - The robber will call the player on his lie
        and act as though he refused.
      - Refuse - The player will be shot and will go to Underworld.
        The robber will go hide out on Dream Train to avoid the
        police. Move to state ~hiding~.
**** chasing
     The robber will keep a low profile and will not be able to be
     found. In this state, the Shady Alley will reveal a Silver Coin.
     If the Shady Alley coin has been collected (~sa-coin~) and the
     player goes to the Underworld hub, then the game moves to ~no~.
**** island
     The robber will end up on the Warehouse island. The player can
     talk to him. The robber will say that he ended up not needing the
     player's money and will return whatever he stole (~stolen-good~).
     He will then leave and the game will revert to ~no~.
     Alternatively, telling the police will result in the `hunted`
     state. If the player approaches the Warehouse island while
     Attorney-Man is also serving justice there (~attorney-man~ in
     state ~fed~ or above), Attorney-Man will automatically chastise
     him, sending the game back to ~no~ and returning the stolen item.
**** hiding
     The robber will be on the Dream Train. The player can talk to
     him, where he will apologize for shooting the player and claim
     that it was "just business". The game then moves to ~no~ as the
     robber leaves the train. Alternatively, if the player pulls the
     emergency brake, the robber will run off into the moonscape, and
     the game will move to ~no~.

     //// What then?
**** hunted
     The robber will be caught and moved to the dining hall in the
     prison. If the player talks to him, the game moves to ~caught~.
**** caught
      If the player talks to the police (with a clean criminal record,
      according to the Trial Event), they will present him with the
      stolen good he lost. If the Platinum Card has not been obtained
      (~thug-card~), they will also present him with that, and he will
      be asked to choose which one was his. After doing so, the game
      reverts to ~no~.
*** Trial Event (~trial-crime~)
**** no
     The player has not been arrested. When the player is arrested for
     confessing to murder, the game will go to state ~court~,
     trial-reason will go to state ~murder~, and the player is moved
     to the courtroom, where the trial will proceed. If the player
     should end up in prison in this state, he can speak to the
     warden, who will promptly release him with an apology.

     //// Warden stuff is not in the game right now
**** court
     The player is given the option to plead guilty or innocent. If he
     pleads guilty, he is convicted. If he pleads innocent and lacks a
     lawyer, he will be convicted anyway. In the case of conviction,
     the game moves to ~prison~ and the player is moved to prison.
     Once again, if the player ends up in prison, the warden will
     happily release him. Alternatively, he can use Dr. Cipher in the
     Underworld to reset this state to ~no~.

     If the player has a lawyer, he will escape the trial. However, he
     will be captured on sight by the police and taken back to the
     courtroom.
**** prison
     In this state, if the player moves to the police station, he will
     be apprehended and tried in court, moving back to state ~court~.
     If the player visits Dr. Cipher, his Document Transmogrifier will
     reset this to ~no~.

     If the player has a lawyer, he will escape the trial. However, he
     will be captured on sight by the police and taken back to the
     courtroom.
*** Gate Guard Event (~prison-guard~)
**** no
     The prison guard stands at the gate. The player can talk to him
     and bribe the guard with a Silver Coin, releasing the player back
     to the city and moving to `paid`. Note that even though the
     player has been freed from prison, he does not have a clean
     record and will be arrested on sight if he returns to the police
     station.
**** paid
     If the player ends up in prison again, the guard will still be
     there. He will initially resist releasing the player but will
     relent when reminded of the bribe. The player is released and the
     game moves to `fired`.
**** fired
     The third time the player is in prison, there will be a female
     guard in place of the original guard. She will not be amenable to
     bribes and will not release the player. When the player speaks to
     her, the game moves to `search`.
**** search
     The mustached guard is sitting in the corner of the dream world
     airport. The player can speak to him, and he will complain about
     being fired. If Attorney-Man is accepting clients (attorney-man),
     then the player will have the option to tell the guard about
     Attorney-Man. If he does so, the attorney-guard flag will be set
     to `okay`. In this state, when the player arrives at the prison's
     gate, attorney-guard will be set to `seen` and the game will move
     to `cleared`.
**** cleared
     The guard is grateful to the player for helping him and will
     release him from prison whenever he wants. If the player asks the
     guard about Attorney-Man, attorney-guard will be set to `yes` and
     ~attorney-man~ will be updated to reflect the new client.
*** Johnny Death Event (~johnny-quest~)
**** no
     Johnny Death is in the Underworld balcony and is seeking souls
     for his display case. When the player encounters him, he will ask
     for help stealing souls for his display. If the player accepts,
     he will be given the Soul Crystal and the Elevator Access Key so
     that he can exit the Underworld. The game moves to `accepted`.
**** accepted
     Johnny is waiting to receive souls from the player. The souls
     that are available are in the prison exercise fields
     (exercise-soul), the subspace taco shop (guard-soul), and ...
     When the first soul is brought to him, Johnny will tell the
     player about Dr. Cipher's invention and the game will move to
     `1`.
**** 1
     Johnny is waiting to receive more souls. When the second soul is
     brought to him, Johnny will upgrade the player's Elevator Access
     Key into an Upgraded Elevator Access Key. The game will then move
     to `2`.
**** 2
     Johnny is waiting for one more soul. When the third and final
     soul is brought to him, Johnny will open all the doors in the
     lobby, giving the player access to all of the rooms. In
     particular, this opens the mercury room, which contains the Cream
     Cheese Muffin. The game also moves to `done` at this time.
**** done
     Johnny's collection is complete. If the player speaks to him, he
     will simply thank the player.
*** The Butler's Event (~butler-game~)
**** no
     The butler is nowhere to be found. The game will move from this
     state to ~cell~ when the following three conditions are met.
      - The player has just been arrested and moved to the prison.
      - The player has been arrested before (~been-to-prison~).
      - The player has at least one item.
**** cell
     The butler is in the player's prison cell. When he talks to him,
     he will tell the player about the science lab and how to get to
     it. The game then moves to ~cell1~.
**** cell1
     The game will move from this state to ~pawn~ when the following
     three conditions are met.
      - The player has just entered the pawn shop in the present.
      - The player has talked to Dr. Louis (~talked-to-louis~).
      - The player has jumped into the fire pits (~jumped-into-fire~).
**** pawn
     The butler is in the pawn shop in the present. When he talks to
     him, he will give the player a Fireproof Suit. The game then
     moves to ~pawn1~.
**** pawn1
     The game will move from this state to ~shabby~ when the
     following conditions are met.
      - The player has just entered Shabby Jack's in the past.
      - The player has the Soul Crystal.
      - The player has read the note on the warehouse wall
        (~merchant-war~ is not ~no~).
      - The player has initiated discussion with Attorney-Man on the
        island (~attorney-man~ is ~talked1~ or beyond).
**** shabby
     The butler is in Shabby Jack's in the past. When the player talks
     to him, he will give the player a Crystal Ball. The game then
     moves to ~shabby1~.
**** shabby1
     //// Next state
*** Attorney-Man's Career (~attorney-man~)
**** no
     Attorney-Man has not been spoken to, so he will only appear in
     Shabby Jack's in the past. After he introduces himself, the
     player can encourage him or walk away. In the first case, the
     game moves to `talked`. In the second case, it moves to `met`.
**** met
     The player has spoken to Attorney-Man. If he speaks to him again,
     the same options as in `no` will be presented. If the player
     walks away, nothing happens. If the player encourages him, the
     game moves to `talked`.
**** talked
     Attorney-Man in the past will say simply that he will embark on a
     journey soon. In the present, Attorney-Man appears on the
     northern side of the warehouse island. When spoken to, he will
     ask for a taco and the game will move to `talked1`.
**** talked1
     Attorney-Man in the past will continue saying he will embark
     soon. In the present, Attorney-Man remains on the warehouse
     island and continues asking for food. If the player has given the
     Taco Man an olive (~taco-shop~ is ~olive~ or ~fed~), then the
     player can request a taco from the Taco Man. Delivering this taco
     to Attorney-Man moves to the game to `fed`.
**** fed
     In this state, Attorney-Man will wait for cases. The player can
     deliver his own case (~attorney-self~), the robber's case
     (~attorney-thug~), and the prison guard's case
     (~attorney-guard~). Each of these moves the game forward, first
     into ~1~, then ~2~, then ~done~.
**** 1
     See `fed`.
**** 2
     See `fed`.
**** done
     ////
**** complete
     ////
*** The Taco Shop (~taco-shop~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to the taco shop manager. When he does
     so, the game moves to `spoken` or to `olive` if the player has an
     olive. Joe the Time-Traveler will be in the subspace hub and will
     simply complain about hunger.
**** spoken
     The player has spoken to the taco shop manager but has not
     presented him with an olive. The taco shop manager will be
     looking for an olive. When presented with one, the game will move
     to `olive`. Joe the Time-Traveler will still complain about
     hunger.
**** olive
     The player has presented the taco shop manager with an olive. If
     the player talks to Joe the Time-Traveler, the game will move to
     ~fed~ and Joe will move to the taco shop.
**** fed
     Joe the Time-Traveler will, upon being asked, tell the player
     about the secret password to the pawn shop in the past. The game
     will remember that he has done so (~pawn-shop-pass~). After
     completing the bulk of the ~necro-cipher~ quest, the player will
     have the opportunity to acquire the Taco Man's missing Black
     Olive. When the player returns the Black Olive to him, the game
     moves to ~doubled~.
**** doubled
     The player has delivered the Black Olive to the Taco Man.
*** The Hunter's Adventure (~hunter-trail~)
**** no
     The player has not visited the forest outside the prison yet. The
     Hunter is at Shabby Jack's and will simply say he is looking for
     a good forest to hunt in. When the player visits the forest, the
     game will move to `visited`.
**** visited
     The player has visited the forest but not told the Hunter about
     it. When the player tells the Hunter, who is still at Shabby
     Jack's, about it, the game will move to `forest` and the Hunter
     will move to the forest.
**** forest
     The Hunter is in the forest. When the player speaks to him here,
     the player will have the option of suggesting that the Hunter go
     to the cave. If he does so, the game will move to `under` and the
     Hunter will move to the Underworld.
**** under
     The Hunter is in the Underworld.
*** Trip to Subspace (~subspace-reason~)
**** no
     The player has not been sent to subspace yet. If the player ends
     up in subspace in this state, he has done so without causing a
     paradox or otherwise. When the player is sent to subspace,
     depending on the reason, the game will move to `arrest`.
**** arrest
     The player was sent to subspace as a result of confessing to a
     crime in the past. This implies that the player had an unclean
     criminal record at the start of the present day, which
     contradicts the order of events.
**** button
     The player caused the time machine (which did not work yet) to
     explode in the past, making it impossible that he operate it in
     the present.
*** Evil Flame Spirit (~fire-pit~)
**** no
     The player has not begun to approach the evil flame spirit. When
     the player visits the fire pits with the Fireproof Suit, the game
     will move to `odd`.
**** odd
     The player has been to the fire pits successfully once. When the
     player visits the starting area of the big city, the game will
     move to `even`.
**** even
     The player has been to the pits and back once.

     //// Player must have at least two science keys
**** next
     ////
**** seen
     ////
**** talked
     ////
*** The Necromancy Certificate (~necro-cipher~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to Dr. Cipher about his Necromancy
     Certificate yet. If the player talks to Dr. Cipher after the
     Butler's second event (~butler-game~ is ~pawn1~ or beyond) and
     after using the pawn shop password (~pawn-shop-pass~ is ~yes~),
     Dr. Cipher will seem mildly alarmed by something. If the player
     asks what is wrong, Dr. Cipher will explain that his Necromancy
     Certificate has been stolen. The game will then proceed to
     ~spoken~.
**** spoken
     The player has been sent to look for the Necromancy Certificate.
     Joe the Time-Traveler will have it at the taco shop in subspace.
     When the player approaches him, Joe will insist that it is a
     family heirloom, not a cursed artifact. If the player presses
     him, he will not give, but the game will move to ~found~.
**** found
     The player has found the Certificate, but Joe will not give it
     up. The player must return to Dr. Cipher and share his findings.
     When the player tells Dr. Cipher, he will confirm that Joe's
     scroll is in fact the Certificate and tell the player to claim
     the Certificate at all costs. The game will move to ~encouraged~.
**** encouraged
     Having been reassured that Joe definitely has the Certificate,
     the player must confront Joe again. When he does so, Joe will
     confess to stealing the Certificate but will claim that Dr.
     Cipher is the villain. The player has the option of buying into
     his story, but it doesn't matter, because either way, Joe will
     decide that the player knows too much. Joe activates the
     Necromancy Certificate and the game moves to ~rising~.
**** rising
     Joe has activated the Certificate and is summoning the spirits of
     the dead. The player has the option to fight him then and there.
     If he does so, the player will enter one-on-one turn-based combat
     with Joe, who will proceed to summarily curbstomp him, sending
     the player to the underworld. Instead, if the player visits
     Atheena the Hero, she will offer to help in the fight against
     Joe, moving the game to ~help~.
**** help
     Atheena is at the taco shop waiting to confront Joe with the
     player. The battle will now go much more smoothly, and the player
     and Atheena will win. Joe will be banished to the underworld,
     where Dr. Cipher will see that justice is served. The Necromancy
     Certificate falls into a void which leads to the abyss. Atheena
     will return to the portal room. The game moves to ~beaten~.
**** beaten
     Joe has been defeated, but the Certificate has not been
     recovered. It has fallen into the hands of the Reaper in the
     abyss. When the player addresses the Reaper, he will offer the
     player either the Black Olive or the Necromancy Certificate. The
     player must choose one (~reaper-has-item~) to take for free. The
     other item will become available after completing a quest for the
     Reaper. Upon choosing the first item, the game moves to ~item~.
**** item
     The player has the option to give Dr. Cipher the Certificate, if
     he has it. If the player chose the Olive from the Reaper, he will
     have to wait until he completes the Reaper's quest to get the
     other. Regardless, once the player returns the Certificate, Dr.
     Cipher will give him the Heart Key and the game will move to
     ~yes~.
**** yes
     Dr. Cipher has the Certificate, Joe has been captured, and the
     player has the Heart Key. Mission accomplished.
*** The Reaper's Desire (~reaper-helper~)
**** no
     The player has not done anything for the Reaper yet. When the
     player claims an item from the Reaper via ~necro-cipher~ in
     ~beaten~, the game moves to ~item~.
**** item
     The player has claimed one item from the Reaper, but the Reaper
     is not ready to give the player a quest. If the player asks for
     the other item in this state, the Reaper will decline to give it.
     After the player reenters the starting area of the game, the game
     moves to ~reset~.
**** reset
     The player has been back to the hub area. If the player has
     triggered the third butler event (~butler-game~ is ~shabby1~ or
     beyond) and the game is in this state when he talks to the
     Reaper, then he will offer a quest based around reclaiming an
     item from the Ancient Minister. Upon accepting the quest, the
     game moves to ~accepted~ and the player receives the Reaper's
     blessing (~reaper-blessing~).
**** accepted
     The player has accepted the Reaper's quest. Now, if he attempts
     to take the Cursed Chest from the subspace temple, he will
     succeed. The Cursed Chest is locked, so the Reaper will not
     accept it in its current state. Instead, the player must take the
     Cursed Chest to Steve's. Steve will agree to open the chest in
     exchange for the player holding onto the Suspicious Briefcase for
     her. At that time, the game will move to ~locksmith~.
**** locksmith
     Steve hasn't gotten around to working on the Cursed Chest yet.
     When the player leaves the locksmith's shop, she will get around
     to it, so the game will move to ~locksmith1~ and
     ~steve-disappeared~ will move to ~gone~.
**** locksmith1
     Steve has disappeared and is completely inaccessible for the
     moment. If the player speaks to the Reaper, he will refer him to
     Johnny. Johnny can bring Steve back in the Other Room
     (~steve-disappeared~ moves to ~resurrected~). At any point in
     this state, the player can take the chest back from Steve's shop
     in the past. After the player talks to Steve in the Other Room,
     the game moves to ~locksmith2~.
**** locksmith2
     The player has spoken to Steve in the underworld. The game will
     remain in this state until he delivers the Cursed Chest to Steve,
     at which time the previous Reaper will be released. The previous
     Reaper will thank the player and fade back toward the abyss,
     leaving Steve understandably confused. At this time, the game
     moves to ~recovered~.
**** recovered
     The two Reapers have merged. If the player visits them, they will
     thank him and offer the item as promised. ~reaper-has-item~ will
     move to ~0~ and the game will move to ~yes~.
*** The Captain's Anchor (~captain-boat~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to the captain yet. The captain will
     not appear until the second Butler event. When the player speaks
     to him, the captain will mention that his ship is missing its
     wheel, and the game will move to ~spoken~.
**** spoken
     The captain has asked the player for a wheel and hinted rather
     heavily that the Pawnbroker may have one. If the player visits
     the Pawnbroker in the present, he will say he doesn't have one
     and that he wishes the player had requested the item earlier that
     day. If the player visits the Pawnbroker in the past, he can make
     a request for the wheel, and the game will move to ~requested~ at
     that time.
**** requested
     The player has requested the wheel. The Pawnbroker in the present
     will have the item available. It costs the player one Silver Coin
     to purchase, and upon buying it, the player receives the Ship's
     Wheel and the game moves to ~obtained~.
**** obtained
     The player has the Ship's Wheel and must deliver it to the
     captain. Upon delivering it, the game moves to ~yes~.
**** yes
     The captain has the Ship's Wheel and will allow the player to
     board his ship freely.
*** Unfinished Business (~motel-ghost~)
**** no
     The motel ghost is invisible. The player cannot encounter him in
     this state. When the player first visits the floor of the Abyss
     containing the Reaper, the game moves to `visited`.
**** visited
     The player can now see the ghost. If the player talks to him, he
     will want to tell his story. After hearing his story, the game
     will move to `motel`.
**** motel
     The player can tell the ghost where he is "meant" to go. He can
     send him to the prison (`prison`), the island (`warehouse`), or
     subspace (`subspace`). In any case, the game will move to the
     respective state. The ghost will not go to a location in which he
     has already completed his business (respectively, motel-prison,
     motel-warehouse, and motel-subspace).
**** prison
     ////
**** subspace
     ////
**** warehouse
     ////
**** yes
     ////
*** The Great Robot War (~merchant-war~)
**** no
     The player has not initiated the Merchant-bot quest. In this
     state, if the player visits the east side of the warehouse
     island, he will see a message scribbled into the warehouse wall,
     begging for help for an unknown author against an oppressive
     mastermind. Upon reading this note, the game moves to ~noted~.
**** noted
     The player can now notice the large tree in the forest and
     examine it. However, the player must have the Shovel to continue
     on this quest. If the player digs around the tree with the
     Shovel, he will get the Rusty Warehouse Key and the game will
     move to ~warehouse~.
**** warehouse
     The player has obtained the Rusty Warehouse Key. He needs to use
     it to unlock the warehouse front door. When he does so, the game
     moves to ~unlocked~.
**** unlocked
     The player needs to investigate the rest of the warehouse. In the
     back, he will find a Cryptic Note that he can't decipher. Upon
     taking the note, the game moves to ~crypto~.
**** crypto
     From here, the player needs to take the Cryptic Note to Arthur
     Miles of ~crypto-king~. Upon delivering the note, the game moves
     to ~crypto1~.
**** crypto1
     The player has given the Cryptic Note to Arthur. In this state,
     Arthur has not deciphered it yet. When the player enters the
     starting hub area of the map, the game moves to ~deciphered~.
**** deciphered
     The note has been deciphered. When the player talks to Arthur, he
     will immediately read the deciphered note, moving the game to
     ~chip~. //// Does Merchant-bot go to the underworld when he dies?
**** chip
     ////
**** yes
     ////
*** The Talking Fence (~the-fence~)
**** no
     The player has not spoken to the sentient Fence in the prison
     yard yet. When the player attempts to climb over the Fence, it
     will interrupt him. The Fence will then proceed to explain its
     goal of building something and ask the player for a paperclip.
     The game moves to ~paperclip~.
**** paperclip
     The Fence wants a paperclip. In this state, the pawnbroker will
     give the player a vague hint as to the location of the paperclip
     if asked. If the player offers the Brass Paperclip, the Fence
     will take it and the game will move to ~paperclip1~.
**** paperclip1
     The Fence has the paperclip. When the player enters the north
     prison hallway, the game moves to ~shovel~.
**** shovel
     ////
**** shovel1
     ////
*** Spirit of the Cottage (~cottage-spirit~)
**** no
     The cottage quest has not been initiated. Silver Starlight is not
     yet at the cottage. When the player arrives at the cottage, the
     family will be around, generally doing housework. The player
     needs to talk to the man of the house to advance the game to
     ~evil~.
**** evil
     The player has spoken to the owner of the cottage, but nothing
     has happened yet. If the player visits the starting area and the
     first Butler event has occured (~butler-game~ is ~cell1~ or
     above), the game will move to ~starlight~.
**** starlight
     When the player returns to the cottage, the family will be
     huddled together at the house. In the shed, Silver Starlight will
     be searching for evil spirits. When the player talks to her, she
     will go through a lengthy introduction and then explain that she
     is tracing a source of evil but lost her magic scepter. She is
     trying to build a new scepter, but she needs a crystal ball to do
     it. When the player agrees to find a crystal ball for her, the
     game will move to ~starlight1~.
**** starlight1
     After the player obtains the Crystal Ball from the Butler, the
     player can offer to give the Crystal Ball to Starlight. Upon
     doing so, she will open a portal to the pocket dimension the
     spirits are hiding in, and the game will move to ~pocket~.
**** pocket
     The pocket dimension is open. This is the state the game will
     remain in as long as the spirits have not been completely
     defeated. ~false-stage~ will detail the player's current progress
     in the simulation world.

*** The Pirate Raid (~pirate-attack~)
**** no
     The pirates have not raided yet and will not be seen. After the
     player rides the dream ship to the warehouse island, the game
     will move to ~ready~.
**** ready
     The pirates have not raided yet but will raid next time. The
     pirates will only raid when the captain's ship leaves from the
     dream port, and the ship will return to the dream port after the
     raid. Once the pirates have attacked once, the game moves to
     ~attacked~.
**** attacked
     The pirates have attacked. They will continue to do so anytime
     the player sets sail. The Captain (of the dream ship) will warn
     him of this, and will tell him he needs to go find a pirate
     disguise to fool them. When the Captain gives him this
     information, the game moves to ~hat~.
**** hat
     The player needs to find a pirate costume. If he talks to the
     pawnbroker, he'll point him toward the Hatman. Upon being asked,
     the Hatman will want a cowboy hat in return, and the game will
     move to ~hat1~.
**** hat1
     The Hatman wants a cowboy hat. The player can only get it from
     the hunter. The hunter won't give it up as long as he has a soul.
     Once the player obtains the Cowboy Hat, the game moves to ~hat2~.
**** hat2
     The player has obtained the Cowboy Hat and must deliver it to the
     Hatman. When he does so, the game moves to ~disguised~.
**** disguised
     The player has the Pirate Hat but has not yet used it. The player
     must encounter the pirates using the captain's ship as before.
     This time, if the player dons the Pirate Hat and speaks
     correctly, the pirates will accept him and the game will move to
     ~yes~.
**** yes
     The player has befriended the pirates. They will no longer
     attack. Additionally, when the player speaks to the captain,
     there will be an additional destination option, allowing the
     player to visit the pirate ship anytime.
*** Just a Toy (~baby-doll~)
**** no
     The player has not encountered the sentient baby doll yet. The
     doll is in the refrigerator of the hut basement in the city. When
     the player opens the fridge, the doll will be there. If the
     player takes the doll, she will wake up and run off. The game
     then moves to ~running~.
**** running
     The baby doll is in the vacant room in the underworld. When the
     player encounters her, a cutscene occurs. If Steve has not
     occupied the room yet, the baby doll will simply run away and the
     game will move to ~forest~.

     //// And if she has?
**** forest
     The baby doll is by the cottage in the forest. When the player
     encounters her (in the main cottage yard area), a cutscene
     occurs. If the farmer is out, he will panic, but nothing of
     interest will occur. If not, then Starlight will attack the doll,
     chasing her off and causing her to drop the Diamond Key. In
     either case, the game moves to ~outer~. If the doll drops the
     Diamond Key, then ~doll-key~ moves to ~yes~.
**** outer
     ////
*** The Moth King (~moth-king~)
**** no
     The player has not met Mothka yet. Upon meeting Mothka in the
     past in the Heart Room, the game moves to ~met~ and Mothka kills
     the player to prove a point.
**** met
     The player has met Mothka. When he returns to the past in the
     Heart Room, Mothka will begin to respect the player for evading
     death. He will then challenge him to a game of chess. Mothka
     demands that the player meet him in the mime's basement in twelve
     hours' time. The game moves to ~challenged~.
**** challenged
     If the player approaches Mothka in the past, he will simply
     gloat. The player must confront Mothka in the present. ////
*** Brainwashed (~brain-control~)
**** no
     The Mastermind quest has not started yet. The player cannot find
     the Mastermind anywhere. In this state, Mister Midas is in the
     prison cafeteria, already hypnotized. In order for the Mastermind
     quest to start, the player must have satisfied several criteria.
     + The player must be entering the prison washroom.
     + The washroom coin must have already been collected
       (~washroom-coin~ is ~yes~).
     + Harry must already have escaped (~harry-location~ is ~freedom~
       or beyond).
     In this case, the game moves to ~initiated~.
**** initiated
     The player has satisfied the initiation criteria. When the player
     enters the underworld lobby, the game moves to ~washroom~.
**** washroom
     Mister Midas is now in the prison washroom for his hypnosis
     session. When the player talks to Mister Midas, he only spouts
     gibberish once again, but the game moves to ~washroom1~.
**** washroom1
     Mister Midas is still in the prison washroom. When the player
     tries to leave the washroom, the Mastermind will confront him and
     try to hypnotize him. When that fails, he will order Mister Midas
     to kill him. The game then moves to ~hiding~.
**** hiding
     ////
*** Cryptography (~crypto-king~)
**** no
     The player has not met Arthur Miles yet. In this state, he will
     not appear. When the player talks to Carl at the hotel, the game
     moves to ~closer~.
**** closer
     Arthur will still not appear. When the player awakens on the
     dream train in any cabin, the game moves to ~ready~.
**** ready
     The player is ready to meet Arthur. Next time the player enters
     the Ritzy Inn main room, Arthur will storm in and check into his
     room. When this happens, the game moves to ~met~.
**** met
     In this state, the player can ask Carl who Arthur is. After Carl
     explains this, the game moves to ~met1~.
**** met1
     The player can go upstairs and talk to Arthur. In order to get
     into his room, the player needs the Cryptic Note from
     ~merchant-war~. After the player successfully convinces Arthur to
     help him decrypt the message, the game moves to ~yes~.
**** yes
     The player has met and requested help from Arthur.

*** Rescue of Topaz (~topaz-rescue~)
**** no
     The quest to rescue Topaz from the clutches of the Robot King has
     not yet begun. When the player leaves the school day on the bus
     (after getting a grade of B or better), the game moves to
     ~noticed~. In this state, if the player is taken to the deluxe
     reeducation facility, he will semi-accidentally rescue Topaz, and
     the game will move to ~rescuedunmet~.
**** noticed
     Zircon and Garnet have noticed the player. When he next enters
     the inverse city plaza for any reason, Zircon will sneak out and
     grab the player. He then has no choice from here except to follow
     him to their secret hideout, at which time, after a brief
     introduction, the game moves to ~met~. Like in the case of ~no~,
     if the player is taken to the deluxe reeducation facility in this
     state, he will rescue Topaz inadvertently, and the game will move
     in this case to ~rescuedmet~.
**** met
     Zircon and Garnet have introduced themselves. Zircon will
     subsequently ask for the player's help rescuing Topaz. When he
     accepts the quest, the game moves to ~accepted~.
**** accepted
     Zircon has tasked the player with rescuing Topaz. He must fail
     all of his classes at the reeducation facility, at which time he
     will be taken to the deluxe reeducation in the basement. Cinnabar
     and the player will rescue Topaz together, and the two will
     escape the facility while Cinnabar stays back. The game moves to
     ~rescued~ and the player is deposited at the education district.
**** rescued
     The player has rescued Topaz and has been instructed to return to
     the cave. Upon doing so, the team will convene briefly and have a
     meeting, after which the game will move to ~yes~.
**** rescuedmet
     The player has rescued Topaz and has been instructed to return to
     the cave. Upon doing so, the team will convene briefly and have a
     meeting, after which the game will move to ~yes~. The dialogue is
     slightly different, as the player has not officially accepted the
     quest to rescue Topaz, but the result is the same.
**** rescuedunmet
     The player has rescued Topaz and has been instructed to return to
     a secret hideout belonging to him. Upon doing so, he will be
     introduced to the rebellion group, who will convene briefly and
     have a meeting, after which the game will move to ~yes~.

     organization. //// Where are Zircon and Cinnabar now? They have
     no physical presence on the map as of right now.
*** The Second Great Robot War (~king-war~)
**** no
     The player has not accepted Garnet's request for information yet.
     In order to do so, he must have successfully rescued Topaz
     (~topaz-rescue~ is ~yes~) and have been debriefed regarding the
     rescue (~escape-debrief~ is ~yes~). Then, upon talking to Garnet,
     he may request work in the rebellion, at which time the game
     moves to ~understood~.
**** understood
     Garnet has debriefed the player on the Robot King's primary
     allies. He now has the option to try to learn about each of them.
     He can talk to Garnet to accept any of these quests.

     //// Obviously not done
*** Sisters on the Run (~abduction-escape~)
**** no
     The player knows nothing of the lives of June and Julie yet. He
     will gain the first information on them from Masnin Alja, the
     purple elder in the moon prison, who will divulge that they
     escaped from the research lab and are currently on earth, moving
     from motel to motel. At this point, the game moves to ~rumors~.
**** rumors
     The player has heard rumors of the two from Masnin. He may
     question Carl or Todd at the Ritzy Inn about the girls,
     unsuccessfully since they were never there. If he questions
     Shabby Jack in the present, he will simply find out that they
     were there recently. Once ~abduction-discovered~ is equal to
     ~forest~, the player can visit the two in the forest and ask for
     their help, at which point he will receive the Oxygen Pocket
     Dimension and the Intern's Badge, and the game will move to
     ~acquired~.

     again.

* NOTES

** DONE Cave and Lantern
   Cave will lead somewhere cool if you have a light (inverse city)
** ACCEPTED False Imprisonment
   Given gift if falsely imprisoned (according to Warden), maybe
   Religious Artifact. Maybe not according to Warden, since he'll be
   involved in some other shady dealings. Maybe according to guard?
   Consider how this fits together with Election Season.
** DONE Pirates
 + Pirates will eventually attack the dream ship, and if you raid them
   you'll get a Religious Artifact
 + After N uses of the dream ship (probably N=2), pirates attack. If
   you don't have the pirate hat, they kill you. If you do, they think
   you're one of them and give you access to their ship.
 + You get the pirate hat by trading with the Hatman. He wants the
   cowboy hat from the hunter, which you can only get after you take
   his soul.
** DONE Fire Pits
   Past the fire pits, there should be multiple rooms which are
   accessible, not just the freight elevator
** DONE Shop Prices
   Merchant-bot has two items (one at a ridiculous price); there is a
   quest to kill him, which leads to the warehouse office. At that
   time, Merchant-bot 2 takes over and sells the expensive one for
   less
** ACCEPTED Pawnbroker's Items
   Going to the past and requesting an item from the pawnbroker will
   result in that item being available the next day
   + Ship's Wheel
** DONE The Merchant War
 + Todd wants to rebel against Merchant-bot and leaves clues to help
   you do so
 + So to start with, you see Todd's writing on the warehouse wall. It
   leads you to the forest tree, which you dig around using the Shovel
   obtained from the Fence. This gives you the key to... (Warehouse or
   shop). This could go a couple of different ways.
   - *Original Plan* - The key lets you go to the shop, where you try
     unsuccessfully to unplug Merchant-bot. He attacks you, you flee
     and encounter Todd, who explains his plan. Then you go to the
     warehouse and land on top by means of the dream train (maybe need
     to collect a parachute for this). Then you go into the warehouse
     looking for clues, and on the way out Merchant-bot attacks,
     leading to the battle that you win with the Hero's Blade you'll
     borrow from Atheena.
   - *On the Other Hand* - Maybe the key leads to the warehouse. You
     go into the warehouse, find some clues about some collectible
     mcguffins that defeat Merchant-bot, and then get attacked. The
     warehouse is inaccessible now, as Merchant-bot changed the lock.
     So you have to collect the mcguffins (scattered around randomly)
     and then get back to the warehouse by landing on top (again, by
     the train and maybe a parachute) to plug in all of the mcguffins
     that destroy Merchant-bot.
 + The final battle could involve both Atheena and Starlight. Going in
   with only one of them will result in defeat.
   - Atheena won't be able to get close to Merchant-bot to use her
     blade (I guess the robot has lasers for some reason?).
   - Starlight can fire projectiles and stun Merchant-bot but can't
     hold him at bay long enough to attach the device which disables
     him.
   - Together, Starlight can slow Merchant-bot down enough for Atheena
     to stun him, which allows the player to attach the device that
     defeats him.
 + The final version uses the second plan, involving the key leading
   directly to the warehouse. The player finds an encrypted message
   which, when decrypted, tells of a self-destruct chip which can be
   used to defeat Merchant-bot. The battle then proceeds as the above
   bullet might suggest.
** DONE Escaping the Prison
   Help someone escape from prison by creating a diversion on entry.
   + Harry the Arsonist.
** ACCEPTED Foreclosure
 + The subspace bank forecloses some important building or structure,
   requiring you to break into their vault to get the key and reopen
   it (Hero's Crystal)
 + So, thinking about having the item /not/ be the Hero's Crystal. It
   would make more sense if the bank foreclosed on the portal room
   long before Atheena got there.
 + When the player gets the item back, the bank's army of lions chase
   him and block off most areas.
   - Get killed, blocked off.
   - Elevator is blocked by a man who takes the item back.
   - Must go to the mystery room, then subspace, then forest, then
     take prison bus to get to Steve's locksmith shop.
 + Okay, so maybe the bank took the portal device's key (whatever
   we're calling it these days) from the /previous/ owner of the
   portal device, who is now (for whatever reason) in prison. You need
   to talk to him to get some information.
** DONE Scuba Suit
   Diving into the warehouse island water with scuba suit will result
   in an underwater merfolk cavern
** ACCEPTED The Golden Wrench
   The mechanic is missing his Golden Wrench, which is (probably) in
   the undersea kingdom. With it, he can repair the player's broken
   objects
** ACCEPTED The Locksmith's
   Steve's Smash-a-Lock (only open in the past), where you can have
   Steve break open the vault lock to get Atheena's crystal back.
   Also, Steve may give you a Suspicious Briefcase that you must
   deliver to present-day Steve in the prison.

   Note that Steve will be dead by the time you get to the portal
   diamond quest, as the cursed chest of the Reaper killed her. But
   since the Reaper resurrected her, you can find her in the
   underworld working across the hall from Dr. Cipher.
** ACCEPTED The Flame Spirit
   Evil flame spirit appears in the fire pits after N visits. After
   appeasing him by giving him something, ... I dunno, something
   happens ... (Necromancy Certificate? Joe?)

   So not Joe, as we've already done that. Maybe after the events with
   the cottage? The evil flame spirit is awoken because his brethren
   were defeated?

   Waterproof fireball? Needed to fight the shark off the warehouse
   island coast?
** DONE The Minister's Record
   The Ancient Minister will tell you how you ended up in subspace
   (mainly to help the player understand). If the player has no record
   of entering subspace in any "standard" way, then his heart will be
   pure and the Minister will speak to him more frankly, and then....
   something.... (the record of entering subspace can be cleared with
   Dr. Cipher's help)
** ACCEPTED Science Johnson
   Science Johnson controls the console room. His soul is in the abyss
   area and needs to be rescued, but once it is, he will end up
   outside the door to the controls in the console room and explain
   the goal of the game to the player, as well as possibly give him
   hints once he has X muffins.
** ACCEPTED Crispy Joe
   Crispy Joe's Sandwich Shop...? (Prehistory?)
   + Is this the same Joe as Necromancer Joe? Hiding out in prehistory
     after he fled the future and crashed a time machine in the past?
** CONSIDERING The Prehistoric Maze
   Prehistory contains a grocery store with a labyrinth underneath it.
   At the base of the labyrinth (explorable by subspace map? what if
   the subspace map is just a special map that works in subspace,
   labyrinth, and shrunk ventilation and its not specific to
   subspace?) there is a jungle dome with a passcode to get in.

   Let's elaborate on this. I'm thinking it's not just a maze. It's a
   whole sequence of trials. There will be some branching involved.
   There are a few rewards you can get pretty immediately. Then
   there's a separate area you can only get to after Wordsmith has
   made his move, which gives you the ability to (somehow) travel to
   medieval times. Then a final area only accessible after defeating
   the Wordsmith, wherein lies the Supreme Muffin itself.

   Possibly also related to Cloud World. Maybe the Cloud Shoes need
   some kind of upgrade before the player can fulfill the prophecy.
   The upgrade is one of the rewards in the trials. Perhaps the cloud
   people designed the trials some time ago, for that reason (and
   placed some safeguards in just in case someone, say, happened to
   ignite the earth using a neighboring star). They have to unlock the
   Cloud Shoes ending (or possibly the whole chamber).

   Summary of the ideas we have for different prehistory chambers (the
   resulting chambers will be numbered but you will not go through
   them in numerical order):
   + A grocery store with a labyrinth underneath
   + A jungle dome with a passcode needed to get in
   + A door that requires the fully activated Primordial Wands to get
     through (see Thunder Staff)
   + A sphinx who asks riddles
   + A blue grid with booby traps scattered throughout; there's no
     "correct" way through and you must hit one of the traps that
     drops you down into the chamber below
   + A block-pushing puzzle with multiple exits.
   + A fishing pond.
   + A dark maze, Lost Woods style
   + Three pedestals that must be stood on in the correct order to
     open the way forward (the correct order is indicated in another
     trial). Later, when Atheena, Dr. Louis, and the player are here
     to stop the Wordsmith, they step on all three and open a secret
     exit.
   + A destroyed chamber. It's completely broken.
   + A swordfighting simulation.
   + A pit of snakes and fire
   + A groundhog day loop involving a home break-in and hiding in the
     closet
   + A conference room with a presentation
   + A murder mystery like the one in A Peaceful Cruise but more
     elaborate (Man in the Black Mask is there?)
** DONE The Reaper's Favor
 + The Reaper calls in the player's favor. Possibly to help retrieve a
   stolen item from the Ancient Minister (do they have a rivalry or
   something?).
 + If the Reaper has both the Black Olive and the Necromancy
   Certificate, then what if he only gives the player one of the two
   (player gets to choose) then requires a quest for the other?
 + The True Reaper is sealed away in the Ancient Minister's temple?
   Sealed away in a chest that only Steve's Smash-a-Lock can help
   with?
 + Johnny Death's father is the True Reaper (previous to the current
   Reaper), sealed away by the Ancient Minister? //// (This hasn't
   been explicitly established)
** Missing Rewards, etc.
 + [ ] Attorney-Man's reward? (see below)
 + [ ] The Black Olive needs to do something +(double subspace???)+
 + [X] Heart Room in the past does something? (possibly just an easter
   egg; exit blocked off?)
   - The Heart Room in the past is now the source of Mothka.
 + [ ] Steve's Suspicious Briefcase doesn't do anything right now.
 + [ ] The Religious Artifact from the pirate ship does nothing. There
   will also likely be a second (third?) one somewhere.
 + [ ] Make sure the Mime doesn't disappear before you break the pipe
   in the past, as he's the only other way to get to that area until
   you break the pipe.
 + [ ] The pipe in the past that you expose should appear in some form
   in the present.
 + [ ] Trenchcoat Man's Business Card does nothing right now. (see
   below)
 + [ ] ... ... ... Persimmons
 + [ ] I'm not totally happy with the Minister's memory being tied to
   Dr. Cipher's machine. What if the Minister's memory reset at some
   other (sufficiently liberal) condition? Maybe even by simply asking
   him to reset you and send you back to the city?
 + [ ] Canonically, cars don't exist in this world (See Rogue
   Transport). So there shouldn't be a truck taking you from the city
   to the prison. It should be a bus instead.
** CONSIDERING The Flaming Axe
 + The Flaming Axe of Doom was used by the First Reaper to carve out
   the Underworld before time itself. Possibly, we can visit this
   place before time itself by supercharging the prehistory time
   machine. Visiting prehistory and heading down to the Underworld
   will encounter maybe an earlier Reaper?
   - Or maybe just at the beginning of humanity? I think we've decided
     that the Reaper's underworld is local to earth and other planets
     have their own similar system.
 + Later, the Flaming Axe will show up again in the present day,
   destroying the boundary between the underworld hub and the abyss.
 + The Flaming Axe cannot be touched by the player. If he does so, bad
   things happen (where do you go if you're already dead?). He'll need
   some kind of protection.
** ACCEPTED Mothka's Challenge
 + Queen piece converter (for Mothka game?) (and just, ya know, Mothka
   in general)

   Mothka is in the heart room in the past. He wants to challenge you
   in the present to a game of chess.
** CONSIDERING The RAM
   ........The computer RAM, infinite strip? (in the console room, an
   isolated area?)
** DONE The Fence
   The... Fence... trading to get things, like the shovel.
** Possible Coins
 + [X] Prison sink: silver coin in pipes?
** CONSIDERING The Guardian of Time
   Could the Guardian of Time be chilling in Double Subspace reachable
   with the Black Olive?

   + Note that we may alternatively reach the Guardian during the
     destruction of the world by Atheena's old enemy, as that would be
     something the Guardian would be more deeply interested in.
** CONSIDERING The Twins
 + Twins: the mailman and the taxman. Taxman collects a silver coin at
   some point for tax purposes. Mailman... I dunno, delivers mail?
   - Perhaps the mailman / postman is involved in delivering the
     mannequin for the Arachnarok subplot.
** DONE Turn-Based Combat
   Turn-based RPG-style combat for Joe and Merchant-bot
** DONE Johnny's Souls
   Hunter, inmate, and second prison guard souls for Johnny Death
** DONE The Three Clients
   Attorney-Man and the three clients (player, guard, and robber)
** DONE The Luggage
   The stolen luggage will let you hide in the cargo hold of the dream
   train to make it back to the dream world
** DONE Trading with Todd
   Trade in the fireproof suit for a scuba suit (and vice versa) with
   Todd
** DONE The Necromancy Certificate
   Dr. Cipher wants his Necromancy Certificate back from Joe. Is Joe
   secretly a supervillain who wants to use the Certificate to rule
   the world? If so, the player probably has to go call on Atheena to
   save the world from him. One of the rewards from defeating Joe, in
   addition to a Black Olive stolen from the Taco Man, is that the
   portal to the underworld will remain open, providing a one-way path
   into a new part of the underworld, filled with dark souls and evil
   magic. +Perhaps the Certificate is torn? You have to get it
   repaired?+
** DONE The Underworld Mystery Room
   Too easy to get to Underworld Mystery Room? Consider changing the
   past button to do something else. +(Currently impossible to get there)+
   + You can now get there thanks to Mothka
** CANCELED Shrinking Down
   - Note taken on [2018-10-12 Fri 11:21] \\
     Canceled; the shrinking item is no longer an item but a machine
     that can only be used in one place
   Shrinking item but requires certain power port (purple outlets) to
   use
** CANCELED The Elevator Behind the Tunnel
   - Note taken on [2018-10-12 Fri 11:20] \\
     Cancelled; the warehouse island elevator is behind the fire pits
     and the narrow tunnel leads to the abyss
   On the opposite side of the narrow tunnel in the Underworld
   (accessible with shrinking item), you can access the secret
   elevator which goes to the warehouse island

** ACCEPTED The Reverse Pawn Shop
   In the inverse city, there's a pawn shop owner who wants religious
   artifacts and will give you a muffin for them.
** ACCEPTED Merchant-bot's Friend
   Maybe after the war with Merchant-bot, his friend from the inverse
   world (another Merchant-bot, or some "inverse" version of
   Merchant-bot) wants to send a letter to him. Since the regular
   Merchant-bot is gone (in the underworld? idk. Either way, he won't
   talk to the player), you have to get the key from (present-day)
   Todd and go to the past to talk to past Merchant-bot at his shop.
   + The friend is the Robot King, who has taken over. In his own
     timeline, the Robot King was Merchant-bot 2.0, who took over the
     world and then got to know the regular world's Merchant-bot. He
     warned him about the government plan, allowing Merchant-bot (the
     first) to stay in control of his shop until the player shows up.
** DONE Bank Card
   Just a small thing. But you should be able to /attempt/ to pay
   Atheena's loan with the Platinum Card. It will fail, of course, but
   it should be an option.
** ACCEPTED Corporate
   Johnny Death mentions offhandedly something about a "corporate"
   office. Perhaps the underworld that we know of is just the earth
   underworld (or maybe this world's underworld) and there are others
   that the player may or may not eventually access. Then the
   corporate office is somewhere (in space? subspace?) and eventually
   the player will meet the corporate branch.
   + There's a branch office on the moon?
** CONSIDERING The Top Floor
   The top floor of the Ritzy Inn is where some sort of sinister
   government agency meets to have its meetings. They all have robots
   or something. Idk. Perhaps to get in you have to get a fake
   government ID (from Grigory?) and show it to Carl. (See also The
   Resistance below)

   So yeah, it's worth asking what the conspiracy actually is. They're
   sinister, they all have robot servants, they've probably got their
   hands in several pies (including maybe even being aware of the
   alien experiments on the moon), but... what's the actual evil plan?
   They have to be up to something. I just can't decide what.

   Also, Zircon's father definitely worked for them. Something
   happened to him. I'm pretty sure he's still alive. Was he given to
   the aliens as part of some sort of deal? Maybe he even volunteered
   to save humanity by giving himself up to the aliens.
** CONSIDERING Fighting Mummies
   A secret underground room in the warehouse houses an Egyptian tomb
   with a bunch of mummies (or maybe skeletons) that will jump out at
   you. I don't know. This one's not /too/ well thought out yet.

   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What if the tomb is on the warehouse
   island, and you can get to the island in prehistory too (prehistory
   is pretty small right now, all things considered). In prehistory,
   things are a bit different. Maybe you have to appease the mummies
   while they're alive so that they don't attack you in the present.
** ACCEPTED The Evil Portal
   Okay, this one is going to be long. So there's a cottage in the
   woods reachable from the prison forest by... I haven't decided yet.
   Maybe it's something that happens automatically if you go there
   after a certain point in the game. Maybe you can get there some
   other way after the initial forest visit. I don't know.

   Anyway, in this mysterious cottage, you meet an as yet unnamed
   superhero girl who channels magic powers and is sensing a great
   evil force at the cottage. She'll be building a magic scepter (she
   lost her original one or something) over time, and if you visit her
   after awhile, she'll have completely built it up. She'll open a
   portal to an evil world. Upon the two of you entering, you'll find
   yourself in the audience of a dance show, and she'll be one of the
   performers, having lost her scepter again apparently. Some things
   will happen, and you'll find the true source of the evil. She'll
   reward you with something (maybe a limited form of the magic
   scepter?). You have to go back through the evil portal again
   (she'll happily play it out with you again) to get a hidden muffin
   in the area that can't be obtained when doing the main evil portal
   quest. Whew.

   Related: The cottage may have a wall that can be passed through
   (with some item) to get to the dream world airport.

   Also, the third Butler event will get you the Crystal Ball I think.

   So most of this quest is done. We still need the final victory
   condition and reward. We need to decide where the item you need is.
   I'm thinking /maybe/ in the prehistoric jungle, but that's also
   really late game, so I'm not sure if I want to put it off that
   long. We'll see.
   + The Source in Higher Subspace, perhaps?
** CANCELED The Crystal Ball
   - Note taken on [2018-11-04 Sun 13:06] \\
     Canceled; I want the Silver Starlight event to be fairly
     early-game (as in, you can definitely do it as soon as Butler 3
     happens, and it's not paywall locked). With those constraints,
     it's fairly difficult to come up with a nontrivial route to
     travel along
   For the third Butler event, he gives the Crystal Ball. But it has a
   rule. The Crystal Ball can't travel to the underworld with the
   player if he dies. So he has to find a route back which doesn't
   involve dying.
** ACCEPTED Steve's Later Fate
   After Steve gets taken by the curse of the True Reaper, the player
   will have to resurrect her with Johnny's help. After that, she'll
   be in the Other Room for a bit. Then she'll get her own room in the
   underworld next to Dr. Cipher's, where she'll run a new locksmith
   shop. ////

   When the lions chase the player down after the bank robbery, Steve
   will flee to a safe room in the Ritzy Inn, where the player will
   have to visit her to get the bank vault unlocked. All things
   considered, she may have fled somewhere else for safety then,
   perhaps a safe room at the Ritzy Inn.
** ACCEPTED Harry the Arsonist
   + I don't really know what I'm planning here. Just might be cool to
     have him if we need someone who does something with fire.
   + It's possible he could play into the evil flame spirit in some
     way, given their obvious mutual fascination with fire.
   + Maybe Harry is the guy in prison who you need to help break out.
     After you break him out, he burns something down (the police
     district hut?)
** ACCEPTED The Alien Factory
   Alright, so this is sort of two different ideas that I think fit
   well together.

   Idea 1: A factory. Probably in space or on the moon. Some sort of
   sinister plot going on here. Maybe the aliens are in cahoots with
   the people on the top floor of the Ritzy Inn. Or maybe something
   else. I don't really know yet.

   Idea 2: A guy who locked himself into a room because he turns into
   a giant rock monster if he is exposed to the outside air. The room
   is filled with mirrors, as his reflection stops him from
   transforming. The player has to transform him (which cracks the
   mirror), lure him out of the room, and find another mirror. Then
   he'll turn back and the player can safely visit his room, where
   there's some useful item waiting.

   So, if we combine these two, we get a guy who locked himself in a
   room in the basement of a sinister factory (did the factory
   experiment on him?) to protect everyone from his monster form. As
   one task, the player has to get the item in the mirror room by
   luring the monster out. Separately, as another task, he has to get
   to the bottom of the factory's evil intentions.
   + Is the guy Billy from the inverse world's necromancy plotline?
** CONSIDERING Shark Attack
   So, there's this empty area between the warehouse docks and the
   merfolk kingdom. If you wander around there blindly, a shark will
   find you and chase you, giving us another opportunity for a
   dynamic, resettable interaction like that of the thug.

   1. You wander around underwater. Shark appears. Your options are to
      swim up, swim down, or swim toward the shark. Guess which of
      these options is a bad idea.
      - Swim up (3)
      - Swim down (6)
      - Swim toward (2)

   2. You... swim toward the shark. Eaten alive. Have fun with that.
      Instant death.

   3. The shark chases you and finds itself beached. Probably will get
      a fun panicked reaction out of the captain if he's there. The
      shark will remain beached.
      - Shove him back into the water (4)
      - Shrink down (5)

   4. Shoving him back into the water resets the state. Go to (1).

   5. By going back and using the shrink machine while the shark is
      beached, you can get back to the warehouse island (it's /not/
      easy; you have to have fireproof suit and travel through
      underworld which will probably be hard to get to). You can go
      inside the shark, which... I don't know. Something cool happens
      here, I guess. Then afterward we go back to (3).

   6. You swim into the kingdom. The gatekeeper panics and closes the
      gate, locking the shark out. She won't reopen the gate for you
      (for obvious reasons). For this to work, there needs to be some
      other way out of the kingdom, probably a bed. You can ask the
      gatekeeper, and she'll tell you the shark is terrified of fire.
      - Exit the kingdom (7)
      - Use the fireball you got from probably the flame spirit (8)

   7. Reset. The shark goes away. Everyone's happy. Go to (1).

   8. You chase the shark away. You're a hero. Congratulations. The
      castle gates are now open to you. A new area to explore, some
      new characters, fun stuff. Go to 1.

** ACCEPTED The Resistance
   To fight the sinister government agents (probably those in the
   Ritzy Inn), a resistance has been formed. Their secret base, for
   safety reasons, exists in the dream plane. With a specific item,
   you can pass through the airport walls and find them. Initially,
   you'll encounter one of them somewhere else and that person will
   tell you how to get in.

   Maybe the secret place in the airport has another way out in the
   cottage? I don't know.

   Also, the members of the resistance got to know each other because
   they were all part of the same geology club / department. On paper,
   they still are, but they use those meetings to discuss the
   resistance. That's why all of their codenames are themed after
   types of rocks.

   Okay, so we've reached the point where we need to come up with
   "names" for all the geology club members.
   + Cinnabar (June) is only a club member in the inverse world.
   + Limestone is the player's name once he joins the Resistance in
     the regular world. In the inverse world, he won't really
     officially join them so much as just help out.
   + Topaz is the de facto leader of the group, in both worlds. He is
     level-headed and calmer than his friend Zircon. He tends to
     almost always be at the base, managing affairs.
   + Garnet is the only female member in the regular world, and one of
     two (alongside Cinnabar) in the inverse world. She tends to be
     the computer expert, tasked with hacking government technology
     when needed. In the inverse world, she is the only reason the
     Robot King has not found their digital presence as of yet.
   + Zircon is largely the group's motivating factor, in the real
     world. His father worked for a top secret government project and
     was disappeared one day. They've been investigating conspiracies
     ever since. In both worlds, he tends to be the most violent and
     headstrong. In the regular world, he tends to be in charge of
     recon, and in the inverse world he has become an expert in
     munitions.

   It's worth noting that, at least in the regular world, the
   resistance started out as a couple of friends having fun. Zircon's
   father disappeared (and he worked for the government), so they
   formed a resistance movement to investigate crazy conspiracies,
   mainly as an outlet for Zircon's grief. At the start of the game,
   they're still mostly fooling around, having fun (Zircon's father
   disappeared awhile ago, so the grief is at least somewhat dealt
   with now). Over the course of the game, they stumble upon an
   /actual/ conspiracy and the plot becomes a bit more serious.
** ACCEPTED The Best Tacos
  After the Taco Man has both of his olives, he can make the best
  tacos on the planet. People from all over the multiverse will come
  to his shop. The visitors will rotate out after the player has
  talked to them and then "reset" at the hub. Many of the visitors
  will be available in other areas of the game as well but will act
  more casually at the taco shop.

  Possible visitors
  + The Postman and the Taxman (together or separately?)
  + The Headless Man will also visit the taco shop, but possibly with
    a different trigger so he doesn't depend on the Necromancy quest.
** CONSIDERING Cloud World
   A part of prehistory above the clouds. Maybe the space elevator
   hasn't made it to space yet, or maybe it's just a ladder.

   There are some cloud people there. They live on the clouds and,
   since they're made of clouds, they can walk around on them. If you
   try to enter their village, you'll just fall through the clouds.
   You need the Cloud Shoes. The Cloud Shoes have been lost for
   thousands of years and eventually fall out of the sky and hit
   Attorney-Man in the head. He will give them to you as a reward for
   his main quest.

   Once you have the Cloud Shoes, the cloud people will tell you of
   the prophecy that the Cloud Shoes will only show themselves to the
   chosen hero of legend, whom they believe to be you.

   For those of you following along at home, yes, that means the
   chosen hero of the cloud people is Attorney-Man.

   Okay, more thoughts on the cloud world. The cloud people have
   existed for a long time, before humanity. They stand above the
   earth and maintain its peaceful weather. Unfortunately, they have
   one dark mystical artifact, possibly a box of sorts. If any cloud
   folk is to interact with this artifact, it unleashes the
   thundercloud, which slowly converts their entire species into
   thunderclouds and covers the earth in perpetual downpour. Sure
   enough, somebody has triggered the thundercloud prophecy, and the
   player must put a stop to it.

   Does this result in the end of the cloud people? Perhaps the only
   way to stop their prophecy is to return them all to (non-sentient)
   cloud form. I think we've pretty much decided that the cloud people
   are extinct in the present-day. This event may or may not be the
   one that ends their civilization.

   Were the cloud people created by the First Reaper to guard
   humanity? Maybe the artifact is a way to end humanity if they get
   out of hand.
** ACCEPTED Beneath the Police
   There's a small, suspicious hut in the police district next to the
   otherwise tall buildings. It belongs to a mysterious criminal (the
   Mime?).
   + The Mime is there in the past but ran away in the present for some reason.
   + Trapped in a literal glass box in the inverse world?
   + A refrigerator containing a sentient baby doll.
** ACCEPTED Sentient Baby Doll
   A chase scene? The doll keeps running away and you keep finding it.
   Eventually, it gives you some reward for persistence.

   How did the baby doll get in the fridge to begin with? Clearly, it
   did something bad in the past and the player locked it away. Maybe
   stole a car and chased a nurse? I know that sounds random but it
   makes sense in my head.

   + Ricardo the cop was pursuing the baby doll in the past? Somehow
     that got him caught up in the mime's web?
** CONSIDERING Traveling Circus
   That's what this game needs. It can go to a few different locations
   at different times, as you progress Butler events.
** ACCEPTED Tiny Layout
   So the layout of the tiny city. You'll spend most of the time in
   the ventilation (Grigory) and the sewers (Arachnarok).

   Present
   + The ventilation is available.
   + The sewers link the hut and the hotel. You'll meet Arachnarok.
   + Can enter from Dr. Cipher's lab.

   Past
   + The ventilation is sealed off for some reason (maybe it's just
     the vent is closed right now)
   + The sewers are sealed off from the hotel side but can be forcibly
     opened from the hut side.
   + Can enter from Dr. Cipher's lab or by threatening the mime.
** CONSIDERING Company Policy
   Chuck is an accountant at some corporation (probably some place we
   haven't seen yet). The player meets him (maybe?) at some point.
   Then later, on the ship, the player sees Chuck being deposited into
   the ocean by a large crane. Upon being rescued, Chuck claims that
   it is company policy to deposit fired employees into the ocean and
   asks to be put back. The captain refuses and takes him back to the
   dream world.

   Chuck is scared that he is going to get caught violating his
   contract and will go to jail. The player must find him a false ID
   so he can start a new life.

   Perhaps the robber has the false ID. Maybe it falls out of his
   pocket on the moon? Then the player takes that to Chuck who starts
   a new life, and can be useful in some later quest after meeting
   again by chance. Or maybe Grigory can help with the false ID.
   Sounds like something he would be good at.
** CONSIDERING Obsessed
   All of this happens after ~necro-cipher~ is done (and likely some
   other stuff).

   So there's this guy named Billy. You first encounter him in a
   common area, maybe even the central hub area. He has no idea how he
   got there. Then, shortly after, he's murdered by a woman. Later,
   you find him in the same spot, no memory once again. You can tell
   him to run to different locations to escape the murder. In each
   location, the woman will find him and kill him. Something unique
   may happen at each location depending on where it is.

   Later, you find out that the woman has stolen the Necromancy
   Certificate and is using it to repeatedly kill Billy. Not sure why.
   You need to get it back, after doing the miscellaneous side quest
   stuff relating to sending Billy to the various locations.

   What if this happens to Dr. Cipher's (or Joe's) Certificate in the
   inverse world, rather than having regular Dr. Cipher's Certificate
   stolen twice in rapid succession?

   Oooohh boy... what if this is in the inverse world. But not just
   the inverse world: the beachside resort. Think about it. A couple
   of kids are messing with a time machine, and at the same time, this
   woman is manipulating the fabric of reality with the stolen
   Certificate. It's the perfect storm for a time loop.
** ACCEPTED Star of the Show
   At some point, a major villain (potentially the wizard from
   Atheena's past) will harness the power of a distant star and try to
   use it to destroy the world. Likely, you will (of course) need
   Atheena's help to stop him.

   Surviving areas:
   + Inverse City (totally fine, actually)
   + Space (the areas not in our solar system)
   + Subspace
   + Console Room (but Science probably died in the heat death of earth)
   + Prehistory (but Crispy Joe doesn't exist anymore)
   + Dream World
   We need to make sure there's some way to get between these areas
   that doesn't visit an ignited area. Sleeping will get you to the
   dream train and then the dream world instantly, as the train won't
   go back to earth. Dying will... we'll have to think about that
   given that the underworld is exploded.

   Okay, second draft, and more thought out this time.

   At some point super late in the game, the player goes to some
   surviving area and finds that the ways back to the mortal world are
   gone. He visits Atheena, who has a hunch of what's going on.

   An evil wizard in medieval times harnessed the energy of a nearby
   star and used it to threaten the king. He gave the king one week to
   forfeit the throne to him or he would destroy the planet. The king
   sent his best warriors, including Atheena, to fight the wizard. The
   wizard killed most of the warriors and sent Atheena to subspace
   (maybe he doesn't kill women?). Then, one week later, he played his
   hand and destroyed the planet with that star. All of the
   present-day destinations (city, past city, prison, etc.) are gone,
   the underworld is gone, and the only areas that remain are those
   outside of time or sufficiently far from earth. Additionally,
   anyone originally from the present day (Science Johnson, Crispy
   Joe, the female prison guard) ceases to exist.

   Atheena somehow gets the player to the Guardian of Time, who
   stabilizes the player's existence as he would also be wiped out
   soon. Then the player has to navigate the six surviving areas of
   the map (five, really, because the console room won't do you any
   good) and create something to plant in prehistory which will
   activate and stop the wizard in a few thousand years.

   What caused things to play out differently the second time? Someone
   (maybe "One Word" guy) traveled back and changed things, knowing
   full well what he was doing.

   So just a random thought. How do we get to the Guardian of Time?
   Originally, I was thinking he owed Atheena a favor for something.
   But what if he's the +third+ fourth spicy food visit, and you have
   to have done the other +two+ three before getting there. Then the
   taco man cooks something to help you.
** ACCEPTED One Word
   A bad guy has discovered an ancient word which, if said in the
   right conditions, will destroy the planet instantly. You go back in
   time and enlist that bad guy's help in fighting him in the present
   day.

   [Ezekiel Morrow / Wordsmith]

   Before going back in time, he asks for history books from the
   player. The player cooperates, as he tells the player he is but a
   humble professor (which is admittedly true but not the whole truth).
   + One history book from the city
   + One history book from the prison, perhaps?
   + One history book from the parallel world (maybe a hidden room
     only accessible after Robot King's defeat)
   + One history book from somewhere in space
** ACCEPTED Mind Control
   At some point early in the game (Butler 1, maybe), the player will
   meet an as yet unnamed evil mastermind. This mastermind has come up
   with an evil plan to take over the world. He invites the player to
   come visit him somewhere. When he does so, the mastermind will
   brainwash the player. From this point, the player's choices do not
   matter; he is led involuntarily to a confrontation that ultimately
   results in his death. The player goes to the underworld, and he is
   free of the mastermind's spell.

   The mastermind has left his usual hideout (wherever that was). Over
   the course of the next little while, the mastermind will kidnap and
   brainwash a handful of characters, who will stop performing their
   usual tasks and instead kill the player upon interaction (or maybe
   simply mutter gibberish). Eventually, the player will find the
   mastermind again, who will flee from him. The mastermind flees into
   the presidential ballroom in the Ritzy Inn, where he will collect
   all of his brainwash victims. If the player confronts him, the
   brainwash victims will win. The player will have to do something to
   get through the crowd (probably a special item).

   Once the player gets through the crowd, the mastermind will reveal
   his true plan: to brainwash the entire city and rule over it as
   dictator. I don't know exactly how the player is supposed to stop
   him from there. We'll have to think about it.
** ACCEPTED Delicious
   There could be four different foods in the game that are
   incredibly spicy.
   + [ ] Spicy Taco (made with Black Olive from Taco Man)
   + [ ] Spicy Chili (made by Dr. Cipher as thanks)
   + [ ] Spicy Burger (made by the train chef)
   + [X] Spicy Soup (made by the hotel)

   Each time the player eats a spicy food, he's taken to a special
   part of subspace. There are four doors, and each time a new door
   opens. Behind each door is a special character.
   + [X] First visit: The Man in the Trenchcoat
   + [ ] Second visit: The Postmaster
   + [ ] Third visit: The Source
   + [ ] Fourth visit: The Guardian of Time

   + The Guardian of Time (possibly only allowed during the One Word fiasco)?
   + The Postmaster (manages the Postman)?
   + The Source (magic sentient crystal that can unlock Starlight's true power)?
   + The Man in the Trenchcoat?
   + The Man in the Black Mask (see Alien Apocalypse)

   Considering switching the order of the second and third visit. The
   Source should be useful with Starlight as soon as Butler 3, whereas
   the Postmaster is only useful after Arachnarok is triggered (and I
   don't necessarily know when that is yet), possibly but not
   necessarily after the Robot King's overthrow.
** CONSIDERING Headless
   After some time passes (at least after the Green Olive, maybe some
   more prereqs), a man without a head starts hanging out in the taco
   shop. The player needs to somehow find a way to communicate with
   him, so he can warn the player about his head, which is plotting to
   build a robotic mech suit and destroy the city.
** CONSIDERING Subspaces
   There are a lot of different subspaces, and the Minister exists in
   all of them. The Minister can transfer himself and others between
   the different ones. He also decides which subspace someone ends up
   in when they cause a paradox.

   The Headless Man came from a different subspace. The Minister sent
   him to the player's subspace to seek help. His head is still in the
   other subspace. Once the player decipher's the Headless Man's
   miming (and has the Minister's favor), he'll be able to request
   that the Minister send him to that other subspace.
** ACCEPTED The Midas Touch
   A common criminal who calls himself Mister Midas after the
   mythological figure. Steals exclusively gold jewelry.

   Mister Midas is Mastermind's first victim, in the prison washroom. ////

   Something will happen super late game with him, since he only
   really has any semblance of free will post-Mastermind. Not sure
   what yet.
** CONSIDERING Below the Bottom of the Sea
   What's below the bottom? I'm thinking that you can fire the pirate
   cannon and it will blow a hole in one of the merfolk homes. But
   where does that hole lead? The parallel world perhaps? Or maybe the
   prehistoric pyramid? You know, just a random portal through time at
   the bottom of the ocean... nothing to see here.
** ACCEPTED Twin Studies
   So we already know the aliens are experimenting on humans. How
   about this?

   Before the start of the game, two twins, June and Julie, are
   abducted by aliens. The aliens experiment for a bit and end up
   genetically enhancing the twins. June turns bright red and can fire
   lasers from her hands, and Julie turns bright green and can
   manipulate luck. The two used their newfound powers to escape and
   sought refuge back on earth. Unable to hide their new appearance,
   they kept to themselves and swore to never use their powers again.
   However, they do have the Oxygen Pocket Dimension that they stole
   from the aliens, and the player needs that to be able to leave the
   space prison in one piece. Perhaps one of the aliens in the prison
   knows of them and will point the player in the right direction.

   Meanwhile, in the second world, June and Julie went through a
   similar ordeal and swore off their powers at first. However, the
   Robot King took over and successfully hypnotized Julie, using her
   luck-based powers as a valuable asset. June went underground, began
   training with her abilities, and started (or joined?) a resistance
   movement against the Robot King.

   It's worth at least mentioning that, the way I'm currently
   interpreting their powers, Julie is one of the most powerful
   non-god characters in the game. She has no idea how to fully
   utilize her powers, but if she did she could bend the fabric of
   reality to her will by the manipulation of chance and fortune. She
   probably won't ever realize this, but it's worth mentioning. The
   Robot King might even be vaguely aware of this and doing everything
   in his power to make sure she (and her sister) never find out about
   her true power.
** ACCEPTED No More Dreams
   We have the open question of what the dream world in the parallel
   dimension looks like. One option is to have there just be one dream
   world, and if you fall asleep in the other world, the train still
   takes you back to the /original/ starting point of the game.

   But here's an idea. What if someone or something destroyed the
   dream world intentionally (maybe the Robot King to get rid of the
   rebellion's hideout, maybe not). Then, whenever the player sleeps
   in the second world, he ends up in the nuked dream world, dies
   instantly, and wakes up in the mystery room of the (original)
   underworld. We'd have to explore what happened to the dream world,
   but I think it may be an interesting plot point.
** ACCEPTED Johnny Logic
   So, based on the way the quest went and the way Johnny has evolved
   as a character, I don't really like the "I want to collect souls"
   motivation for Johnny's initial quest. I like the quest, but the
   reasoning just makes him (and by extension, the player, for
   abetting) seem more evil than I intend.

   Here's my thought. A hellhound (or something like it, since we're
   not explicitly saying "hell" here) got loose and is hunting these
   three people (inmate, guard, hunter), maybe for something they
   haven't done yet, or maybe for something they did in a past life
   (turns out, reincarnation is a thing in this world?). Johnny needs
   to take their souls and put them somewhere safe. Then the player
   has to go and contain / kill the hellhound (killing it returns it
   to the underworld?), after which the souls are released.

   Maybe Johnny makes "deal with the devil" types of deals to teach
   people lessons. But he usually doesn't collect on the souls; just
   corrupts the wish slightly. However, his dog got loose and is
   trying to collect all of the souls.
   + Prison Inmate - Wished for popularity. So Johnny got him locked
     up for a crime, where he could be the most popular guy in prison.
   + Prison Guard - Wished for the prison guard job. She got it very
     briefly then got fired after Attorney-Man's shenanigans.
   + Hunter - Wished for the perfect game. So Johnny gave him an
     animal he couldn't win against.
   + Science - Maybe Science also made his deal with Johnny. But since
     his wish was so much greater in scope than the others, Johnny
     just went ahead and claimed his soul immediately to teach him a
     lesson. Or perhaps Science made his deal, and Johnny accepted,
     thinking the sheer knowledge would overwhelm him. But when
     Science was actually happy with the result, the Reaper became
     infuriated and claimed Science's soul as retribution.

   I'm thinking now that we're going to scrap the "capture souls" idea
   entirely.
   + The prison inmate can just... not get his soul taken. He'll still
     be in prison. I'll decide on some other subplot for him (he
     needed his own thing anyway, even if Johnny has his soul plot).
     And his own plot will render him unable to send you to the
     Underworld for part of it.
   + The hunter will still want to go to the forest. Once he gets
     there, he'll consider going in the cave. Playing by reverse
     psychology rules, if you encourage him, he chickens out, but if
     you tell him it's not safe, then he'll run in headfirst. You'll
     get his hat later... somehow? Probably have to do something for
     him. (Also need to explain why he goes to the hub side of the
     Underworld, when even someone Johnny needed like Steve required a
     special request to get over there; is he important somehow?)
   + The female prison guard works like she already did. Joins the
     prison, gets fired after Attorney-Man has his say, and then goes
     somewhere. Maybe not subspace. Maybe she just goes to the hotel
     or somewhere to hang out.
   + Science made his deal with some other (unnamed) demon and still
     infuriated the Reaper. Basically, this plotline is the same but
     it wasn't Johnny who made the deal. Johnny is still aware of it
     though.
   + Johnny himself is pursuing his dog. He'll give you hints on where
     to find the dog. If you go find the dog, it kills you. You need
     to collect a chew toy. Each time you encounter the dog, it'll eat
     one of your chew toys and run to the next destination. To
     completely finish catching it, you have to exhaust all of the
     locations. Johnny's reward tiers probably stay the same.

   With the above plan in mind, here are the reward tiers
   + First capture: You get to meet Dr. Cipher. (Be sure to make this
     one easy)
   + Second capture: You get to go to space.
   + Third capture: All hub doors are open.

   And the chew toys (these can be collected in any order)
   + Bone-shaped chew toy: Johnny gives this one to you for free.
   + Rope-shaped chew toy: ???
   + Squid-shaped chew toy: ???

   Note: Could have more than three encounters; just need new reward
   tiers for Johnny below the hub door reward.
** ACCEPTED Attorney-Man's Reward
   So, whether or not we accept this idea, Attorney-Man needs a
   reward. He literally has none right now.

   But here's a thought. Johnny gives you a reward every time you
   bring him a soul. So why can't Attorney-Man do the same every time
   you bring him a client?
   1. First client gets you the Evil Membership Card. (Evil Business Card?)
   2. Second client gets you Cloud Shoes.
   3. Third client gets you ???
** ACCEPTED Evil Club
   A club in the underworld where all of the stereotypically "evil"
   professions get together and chat and have a good time.
   Attorney-Man got a membership card when he got his law degree, but
   he doesn't use it because he doesn't think he's evil. He gives it
   to you as a reward.

   "Evil" professions:
   - Lawyer (Attorney-Man)
   - Insurance Adjuster
   - CEO

   Okay, so here's a slightly different pitch for the same room. You
   need any business card to get in. Then there's a door in the back
   that you can use to go deeper. You need a second business card to
   go that way. You can keep going deeper, once for each business card
   in the game. Each room looks the same but is aged more. As you go
   back to each subsequent room, all of the same people are there, but
   one of them is gone and the others have no memory of him or her. In
   the final room, when there's no one left, the lights are very dim
   and the room looks unkempt, but there's a muffin in it for you.

   Business Cards
   + Evil Business Card (Attorney-Man)
   + Strange Business Card (Trenchcoat Man)
   + Cryptic Business Card (Cryptographer or Lady Lock)
   + Cursed Business Card (Cursed Artifact Shop)

   People
   + Bouncer
   + To-Be-Named Gullible Guy (ends up unknowingly working for
     Grigory's agency)
   + Shadow assassin (called Midnight in the inverse world, maybe here
     too)
   + To-Be-Named Serpent Scholar (falls into The Serpent's Prison)

** DONE First Time Visitor
   The train is a bit boring when you encounter it the first time. All
   it does it take you back to the hub. Odds are, you came from either
   the prison (in which case is functions as a prison break, at
   least), or Shabby Jack's (in which case you feel really cheated, as
   it does nothing for you). I say we have the first train visit give
   you a reward for being their customer. Something you can get really
   early-game, as it's very possibly the first thing a player will do.

   I would believe the train has a deal with the Ritzy Inn. What if
   the train conductor gives you a meal voucher to the Ritzy Inn?
** CONSIDERING The Sewer King
   King Arachnarok, the Spider King, rules over the sewers beneath the
   city. His son, Prince Arachnarok, is set to marry and take over the
   throne. Unfortunately, he has not found a significant other. His
   father kidnaps some poor human to to the Prince's groom. The King
   won't be reasoned with, so the player has to convince the Prince to
   help him free the human. They find a mannequin somewhere and put it
   in place of the human, and the wedding ceremony goes on as planned.

   Where does the player get the mannequin? Maybe in the other world,
   there's a shop that has them?

   What if the player needs the Postman's help to deliver the
   mannequin to the other world? Maybe he needs the Postmaster to talk
   to the Postman for him before he'll listen.
** CONSIDERING The Trenchcoat Man
   I don't really fully know what I want to do with him yet. He's
   likely to be the first spicy foods visit. But here are some ideas.
   + He gives you a business card that seems initially to serve no
     purpose. Later, Science Johnson will identify a tracker embedded
     into it and find out that the Trenchcoat Man is evil.
   + The Trenchcoat Man's business card is shady and will keep you out
     of some useful area (a bouncer or somebody will smell it on you
     and not let you in). You can try to throw away / shred it
     somewhere, but it will keep coming back. You need to find the
     Trenchcoat Man again, who will show you how to use it properly.
     Maybe he folds it into a paper crane?
   + Is he an enemy of Wordsmith? Perhaps he came to study him?
   + Is he just here to study the Wordsmith? Not to stop him but to
     find out how he did it?
   + Leaning toward the Wordsmith idea, in some form or another. Maybe
     he's not directly an enemy. Trenchcoat Man came from another
     universe (further away than the Robot King's world, implied to be
     closer to the player's origin than most other characters). In his
     world, like in the game's main world, there is a prophecy that
     the Wordsmith (whose identity is as yet unknown) will destroy the
     world, and nothing can stop him. Trenchcoat Man aims to subvert
     the prophecy in his own world, so he's jumping from universe to
     universe, watching the Wordsmith make his play in various worlds
     in the hopes of learning to defeat him.
   + Similar pitch to the above bulletpoint. Trenchcoat Man is from
     another universe (again, implied to be much further away than the
     Robot King's world). He's a scholar and studies the multiverse.
     He's aware of the Wordsmith prophecy (for him, it's simply an
     immutable fact of time that he's observing) and wishes to see it
     play out, for academic purposes.
** CONSIDERING Cryptography
   In the regular world, Arthur Miles is in town for a cryptography
   conference. This isn't explicitly established yet, but I kind of
   had it in my head.

   In the other world, he's in town for a secret underground
   over-the-top hacking contest which takes place in a wrestling ring.
   His hacker name is, of course, the Cryptographer (or Cryptologist,
   or Cryptanalyst, one of the three).

   His opponent is Steve's counterpart in the parallel world: codename
   Lady Lock. After a dramatic introduction, the two will play out
   round one of the competition, which ends in a draw. Before round
   two (possibly a sudden death) will happen, both competitors will
   independently ask the player to cheat for them. You can only cheat
   for one of them, but you can pick which one. After the second round
   of the contest, both will go back to their respective areas. The
   winner will offer to give you part of the prize (Religious
   Artifact?), and the loser will give you a Cryptic Business Card.
   + Is this happening in the beachside resort? It would explain why
     they keep doing it over and over again. And you may even be able
     to get them both to win. Ya know, if it's happening every six
     months or something (twice in the infinite year of the resort).
** CONSIDERING Black Holes
   So at some point on the moon, you steal / hijack / are given a
   spaceship (not sure which). You can fly it to the aliens' home
   planet and do some stuff. Or you can fly it into a black hole,
   which sends you either forward in time or to another world or
   something, where there's an evil tyrant in place and everything is
   evil.

   Possibly multiple black holes? Three is a good number, so we may
   have to remove one of these, but we could always do four.
   + One takes you to a future world where there's an evil tyrant in
     place. You have to stop him. Possibly show Joe in the future or
     something (before going crazy, of course). Or maybe we're not
     that far into the future. (related to Alien Apocalypse below)
   + One takes you to the Hotel of Seasons (see below). You crash into
     the top floor, from which you can access all of the seasons.
     Perhaps the elevator key that takes you to this floor is only
     accessible /inside/ the hotel, hence having to come this way
     first.
   + One takes you to a fractal version of the prison area, where
     physics doesn't necessarily apply normally. (see The Fractal
     Dimension below)
   + What about a school of witches?
** ACCEPTED Cursed Artifact Shop
   In the parallel world? Maybe a cursed artifact shop? Could sell
   cursed objects, like a Cursed Business Card, and other stuff.

   Since there's already a state-sponsored shop selling stuff in the
   inverse world, maybe the cursed shop doesn't take actual money. It
   requires odd things in exchange for the items in the shop.
** ACCEPTED Inverse Tower
   So I hadn't actually written this down. But there will probably be
   a tower in the inverse city. It has several floors, accessible by
   different elevators which don't obey the usual notions of "up" and
   "down". Possible floors:
   + Rooftop :: One exit
   + Cafeteria :: X exits (possibly also accessible from the school
                  somehow?)
   + Office Building :: X exits outside + 1 exit inside
   + Laundry Room :: X exits
   + Basement :: One exit
   + Balcony :: 2-ish exits
   + Garden :: 1 exit inside + 1 exit outside (see Garden at the Top)
   + Library :: X exits (is there some secret literature that the
                Robot King banned in a back room? Maybe something you
                have to bring to regular world Ezekial?)
   + Lobby :: X exits (each is stateful)
   If possible, each elevator has exactly three floors it can access.
** ACCEPTED Reeducation
   The Robot King's school. There's one classroom, and which teacher
   is there depends on the time of day. When you first arrive for the
   first time, it's first period. You can go to the classroom and
   participate in class, which involves answering some questions about
   the Robot King, then the game moves to the next period. After third
   period, you get a "grade" based on how many classes you "passed".

   + Three passes (A) - You get a special audience with the Robot King
     for exceptional performance. Good stuff happens. Not sure exactly
     what yet.
   + Two passes (B) - You are released back into the world, as you've
     still passed.
   + One pass (C) - You fail and are required to complete the courses
     again. Reset to first period.
   + Zero passes (F) - Supreme failure. Taken to a special room for
     additional reeducation. Something fun happens here too.

   The first time you get a grade better than C, the rebellion will
   take notice of you and approach you when you get back to the city.

   + First Period (Governance) is taught by the Judge. When he's not
     at the school, he's with Attorney-Man somewhere in the Robot
     King's castle. Attorney-Man is able to at least partially resist
     the Mesmerist's hypnosis and has fallen into a catatonic state of
     repeating "The Robot King is not justice". The Judge is
     understandably concerned about him. The two are probably friends
     in the inverse world. ////
   + Second Period (English) is taught by Mavis Morrow (Ezekial's
     wife). When she's not at the school, she's at the library with
     Ezekial. ////
   + Third Period (Gym) is taught by Todd and Carl. Carl drives the
     bus when he's not teaching, and Todd is ////
** CONSIDERING Witchcraft
   A witch. I don't know where she'd be in the regular world yet, but
   in the inverse world she could run the cursed artifact shop.

   Perhaps she's collecting humans. Her touch can put someone to sleep
   (which works on the player but doesn't exactly have the intended
   effect). The player may have to stop her at some point. With a
   soccer game, perhaps? I don't know.
** ACCEPTED In the Shadows
   An assassin who can literally disappear into people's shadows.
   Like, he just falls into the shadow and then can stay in their
   shadow until later, when he pops out and kills them. Perhaps he's
   at the evil club and goes to the shady alley to wait for you after
   he disappears.

   In the inverse world, the Robot King supercharged his powers to be
   able to create shadows and block light. He left him in charge of
   the "deluxe reeducation", and you must rescue Topaz from him.

   Assassin party at a mansion? Idk. Also, he might have a
   "girlfriend"?
** DONE The Drawbridge
   Most players, when confronted with the Robot King's city, will go
   straight for the castle, as it's likely to be the most
   exciting-seeming area (when you're choices are "the shopping mall",
   "the library", and "the evil king's castle", which one sounds the
   most exciting?). To circumvent this and make sure the player sees
   the Robot King's oppression before encountering him, we could have
   a drawbridge blocking you from the castle. The drawbridge will
   lower once you talk to anyone in the city. Really, anyone. Just so
   you see what's going on before meeting him.
** CONSIDERING Hint System
   Something I've been thinking about for awhile but haven't written
   down.

   Muffins are hard to find. Some of them are stupidly hard to find.
   Once you get to the console room, we could have an area there where
   you can pay in, say, hint tokens, to get hints as to the locations
   of muffins on the map. Hint tokens could be obtained as optional
   conveniences throughout the map or maybe just automatically given
   the more areas of the map you explore.
** CONSIDERING Muffin Naming
   Right now, the muffin names don't have a lot to do with the muffins
   themselves. While it's cool and all to use "real" muffin names, I
   honestly don't feel like the names are doing that much good. I
   still remember the Banana Nut Muffin as "the judge's muffin", so
   what if we changed the official names to be the more memorable ones.

   + Banana Nut Muffin -> Judge's Muffin
   + Maple Muffin -> Waterlogged Muffin
   + Apple Pecan Muffin -> Baker's Muffin
   + Cream Cheese Muffin -> Mercury Muffin
   + Mango Muffin -> Despair Muffin (?)
   + Blueberry Muffin -> Second Class Muffin (?)
** ACCEPTED The Endgame
   Okay, this is a big one, and it could change the framing device of
   the game a bit.

   So the original plan for the game was: collect all of the muffins
   and bring them to the console room to win. But let's be honest.
   Collecting all of the muffins is a daunting task. Lots of players
   will get almost all the way to the end but won't be able to find
   them all at that rate.

   So here's my very tentative alternate pitch. Wordsmith is the
   closest thing this game has to an overarching plot (introduced very
   early on, only resolved at the end), so we make that official. We
   make the official goal of the game "collect the Supreme Muffin".
   Then Man in the Trenchcoat hints very heavily that the Supreme
   Muffin will be given to whoever defeats the Wordsmith. You've
   "beaten" the game when you collect the Supreme Muffin. The other
   muffins are still definitely worth something, and there could be a
   postgame where you bring the other muffins to the console room to
   get extra points. 100% completion would be given by getting all of
   the muffins to the console room. So, basically, take the original
   pitch of the game and make it be considered 100% completion, and
   add a new, easier objective to be considered beating the game.
** CONSIDERING Wordsmith's Muffin
   So, whether or not we take the above suggestion, the Wordsmith will
   obviously lead to a muffin (possibly the Supreme Muffin). But how?
   The player will likely need Atheena's help to defeat the Wordsmith.
   Maybe she travels back to her own time somehow and stops him
   personally, staying in the medieval era afterwards. She finds the
   (Supreme?) muffin of her own accord and shares its location with a
   trusted ally, who coincidentally is Dr. Louis' ancestor. When the
   player returns to Dr. Louis later, she tells him of this tale,
   passed down through the ages.
** CONSIDERING Assassination Party
   A party at some mansion (reachable by bus) where assassins get
   together and meet to try to kill each other for fun. You get there
   by running into some assassin by chance who invites you there.

   Assassins:
   + Midnight (can conceal himself in one's shadow)
   + Ragtime (can fit into backpacks and briefcases of any size)
   + Crystal (specializes in using valuable gemstones and crystals to
     commit murder)
   + Backflip (see below; can travel back in time a few minutes to
     kill someone)
   + Caveman (a bat-wielding brute)
   + The Referee (retired from assassination but manages the assassin
     party now)
** CONSIDERING The Hotel of Seasons
   In the inverse world, maybe one of the floors of the tower takes
   you to a hotel, where you can get into four different swimming
   pools, each one taking you to the same beachside hotel but in a
   different season. So, overall, you get to see it at four different
   times in the same year. All of the same people are there, and
   causality is flimsy in that area. Would give us a chance to have a
   lot more characters show up in the inverse world who aren't there
   right now.

   The eventual goal, as the Young Love characters will tell you, is
   to get all of the below characters to get out of the hotel. They're
   all trapped in their own time loops for various reasons, and the
   only way to break the cycle is to get them out of the hotel.

   Things which might interact with the Hotel of Seasons
   + Two young teenagers stole a time machine (Young Love)
   + Backflip the assassin (Backwards Assassination)
   + A family gazing at the sea (Ring of Renewal)
   + A trickster evading capture (Shifty Mischief)
   + A woman getting revenge on her boyfriend (Obsessed)
   + An obnoxious fan and a cop (Catching Heat)
   + A high school girl and a pink locker (The Pink Locker)
   + A murder at an opera show (Endless Opera)
** CONSIDERING Young Love
   Heavily related to Hotel of Seasons above. So in the inverse world,
   a young teenage couple does something slightly dangerous. The boy's
   father works for the government and developed a portable time
   travel device, so the couple steals this device for a bit of fun.
   Unfortunately, both the government and several enemy spies begin to
   pursue them. They flee to the hotel mentioned above and use time
   travel to evade their captors. Unfortunately, doing so somehow gets
   the hotel's timeline caught in a loop. No one inside ages or can
   leave, and the same year repeats itself forever. The player must
   help them undo the changes they made to the timeline that created
   this loop. Nobody else in the hotel even knows anything is wrong;
   they all just stay there blindly. Only the couple and the spies
   recognize a problem, and the spies are too busy trying to steal the
   time machine to worry about it.

   In the regular world, the father (Dr. Harris?) may be from a
   partner lab to Dr. Louis' and may come to visit at some point. Not
   sure where his son or his son's girlfriend are in this world.
** ACCEPTED Inverse City Planning
   I've had this written down for a bit. Realized I didn't have it
   here. This is a rough sketch of the inverse city layout. (The
   checkmark indicates that the area exists, not that it is 100%
   complete)
   + [-] Education District
     - [ ] Tower (see Inverse Tower above)
     - [X] School (see Reeducation above)
   + [X] Shopping District
     - [X] Robot King's Shop
     - [X] Cursed Artifact Shop
     - [X] Collector's Shop
     - [X] Elevator Shaft
   + [X] Castle District
     - [X] Castle and Moat
   + [X] Dark Cave
** DONE Sisters' Initial Appearance
   June and Julie currently first appear (in the regular world)
   triggered by the player talking to the purple elder. We could
   always have them appear earlier. I'd want the trigger to be
   strictly before talking to the purple elder, so that they are
   definitely available at that time. We'll see.
** CONSIDERING Bugging the Ball
   What about this? The geology club heard that there was to be an
   important ball in the Ritzy Inn ballroom (the same ballroom that
   will later be used for Mastermind's plan). The rumor is that some
   important government people will be there, and that they may
   exchange some sort of coded message about their future plans. The
   geology club deems it too tightly secured to get into the ball
   proper, but they decide that they may be able to bug the place for
   sound beforehand. Zircon and the player head into the ballroom in
   advance to bug the place. Unfortunately, they are stopped by the
   hotel employees. To get in, they need a labor union card (see
   below), which the player will get from somewhere (Grigory, someone
   at the evil club, or somewhere else?). The union card grants the
   player access to the ballroom, where he and Zircon rig the place.

   (Perhaps the player and Zircon have to clear the place out somehow,
   getting rid of the ballroom staff and anybody else in the room to
   plant their bug. Not sure.)

   Some time later (strictly before Mastermind does his thing), the
   ball happens and the geology club records the audio. They run
   through it and find some sort of encoded message which directs
   their next move.
** CONSIDERING Unionized
   More details on the union card from Bugging the Ball above: It
   actually grants you rapport with all hotel employees (this excludes
   government workers who happen to work in the hotel, such as Dr.
   Louis or the top floor suits).
   + Ballroom staff - The player will be allowed entry into the
     ballroom to bug the place (see above).
   + Carl - Carl will grant the player a gift in support of the union.
   + Todd - In the morning, ???
   + Restaurant Waiter - The waiter will give the player access to the
     restaurant kitchen, which results in ???
   + Cleaning Staff - ??? (There is no cleaning staff in the game
     right now, but this could be interesting. It could also play into
     the stolen luggage, maybe?)
** CONSIDERING Used Cars
   Maybe there's a used car salesman. Yes, in a world where cars don't
   exist. There's a guy who sells used cars. Try and work that one
   out. Maybe he wants something really oddly specific about a car,
   like the door or an alternator or something.

   Is he in the ballroom with the hotel staff?
** CONSIDERING Backwards Assassination
   How about a time traveling assassin? He can travel back, like, at
   most five minutes, to be able to kill you while he's talking to
   you. For some reason, the Guardian of Time is okay with letting him
   continue existing, and the Minister doesn't want to touch him.
   Maybe he's just super careful about it. In the inverse world, he
   could be at the Hotel of Seasons, either stuck in a local time loop
   (and thus only in one season) or traveling backward along the loop,
   since his time abilities don't interact well with the loop. Or
   maybe he's just really nauseous and doesn't feel well because the
   loop is messing with him.

   Maybe he's in the Hotel of Seasons and is nauseous. To get him out,
   you have to convince him you're a doctor (get a stethoscope from
   someone, perhaps by helping the doctors in King of the Hospital),
   and then tell him that your medical advice is to leave the hotel,
   which he'll then oblige to.

   We'll call the guy Backflip, I think.
** CONSIDERING Born of Spacetime
   Two twins, maybe teenagers, live in the subspace temple. A boy and
   a girl. In the original timeline, there were complications during
   (or perhaps shortly after) their birth, and they didn't survive
   (the mother likely didn't either). Despondent, the father somehow
   got his hands on a time machine, went back in time, and tried to
   save his family. He ended up causing a (fairly straightforward)
   paradox. I'm not sure if the Minister was able to save him or not,
   but the Minister was able to save the two kids. The subspace temple
   raised them, and due to the unique circumstances of their birth
   (namely, being dragged through time itself at such a young age),
   they have special abilities. The girl has short-range telekinesis,
   and the boy has a sort of echolocation ability so he can see all
   around him with his eyes closed.

   Sometime later, the government (somehow) gets wind of the twins'
   abilities. They attempt to seize the children but find the subspace
   temple's defenses formidable (or perhaps they're simply smart
   enough not to try). So they reproduce the circumstances,
   manipulating time to influence the birth of a child. The experiment
   is successful, and they produce a young child with the ability to
   control people's minds at a close range. The government was
   planning to mold this child to their military standards, but the
   two twins rescued the child. The young one is now a toddler, being
   protected by the elder two and living in the safety of the subspace
   temple.

   This could play into Headless, if the toddler ends up wandering off
   and getting recruited briefly by the headless man's head.
** CONSIDERING School of Witches
   Where did the witch get her powers? Maybe there's a school
   somewhere out there that teaches young witches how to hone their
   magic. She wasn't originally evil, after all. Something bad
   happened to her. I haven't decided what yet.

   The school could be reachable via a black hole (we already have
   three such destinations, but we could have a fourth), and the witch
   may take/send you there at some point.

   Worth noting that Starlight didn't go to the school. She's probably
   eligible and may have been able to get in, but she was taught by a
   lone mentor (probably a family member) and is at least somewhat
   self-taught. The school of witches is defunct by the time the
   player gets there.

   Alternative thought (I'm just spitballing at the moment): The
   player finds the school of witches in the future tyranny world (see
   Black Holes above), where it's defunct, since most things are by
   this point. At its heyday, it produced the witch from the above
   descriptions, but during the player's explorations it's dead.
** CONSIDERING Thunder Staff
   Playing off of School of Witches above, what if the player finds a
   (seemingly non-functional) magic wand in a treasure chest or
   something at the school? The wand initially does nothing, and the
   player has to take it to Starlight or the witch (probably the
   former, given the latter's disagreeable tendencies) for inspection.
   It is revealed that the wand has a special elemental affinity and
   will reactivate in the presence of intense amounts of that element.

   That element, as it turns out, is lightning. The wand does nothing
   until the player squares off against the stormcloud that started
   the Cloud World prophecy, at which time it activates and becomes an
   immensely powerful thunderstaff.

   Going further. What if there are actually /four/ wands. The four
   Primordial Wands, respectively, of Fire, Water, Earth, and Thunder.
   Each one is located somewhere different (with one located in the
   School of Witches and the others scattered, or perhaps all
   scattered and the true description of them in a textbook at the
   School of Witches). Each Wand must be reactivated by exposing it to
   its natural element.

   + The Evil Flame Spirit can reactivate the Primordial Wand of Fire.
   + Someone in the merfolk kingdom can activate the Primordial Wand
     of Water.
   + The Primordial Wand of Thunder reactivates when battling the
     Thundercloud prophecy.
   + The Primordial Wand of Earth... I haven't decided yet.

   After reactivating all four, there is a special chamber in The
   Prehistoric Maze that accepts all of the Primordial Wands in
   exchange for something (possibly a muffin)
** CONSIDERING The Mouse Thief
   The subspace bank serves one (very late game) purpose right now. We
   could change that. What if there was already a bank robbery earlier
   on? A mouse and her posse (of ordinary humans, mind you) have
   robbed the bank and fled the scene. They're on the run in the Robot
   King's dominion (not sure how they ended up there, to be honest,
   but they're smart enough at least for the moment to evade the Robot
   King's detection). The mouse thief is hiding in one of the floors
   of the tower. The remaining members of the gang are scattered
   elsewhere (or perhaps they were captured by the Robot King and
   hypnotized, while the mouse escaped).
** CONSIDERING Rogue Transport
   There are three ideals of transportation in the dream world. The
   conductor idealizes trains, the captain for boats, and the (as yet
   undesigned) pilot for airplanes. Cars don't exist in this world
   (after all, there's nobody driving one around the dream world, and
   as we all know, if it doesn't exist in dreams, then it doesn't
   exist in real life). But we do have buses, to and from the prison
   as well as serving the Robot King. Why isn't there a bus driver in
   the dream world?

   How about this? There /was/ a bus driver in the dream world. There
   may even still be a bus stop in the dream world. But he tried for
   too much power. He wanted his buses to be the best form of transit,
   to be faster and better, so he started messing with reality and
   went crazy. The other three dream inhabitants banished him, and he
   now wanders... wherever you go if you're banished from dreams. But
   his buses are still warped across reality. This is why the prison
   bus can take you across several timezones in what feels like a
   matter of minutes, and why the Robot King's bus can take you to a
   faraway school so quickly. (Yes, I realized that the
   prison-during-the-day / city-at-night thing was a bit of a plot
   hole. Here's me filling in that hole with an absurd backstory about
   magic buses)
** CONSIDERING The Letter H
   At the dream airport, there's a crazy serial killer with a unique
   quirk. He wants to kill everybody at the airport, but he can only
   pass through doors that have the letter "H" written on them. At
   first, this is fine; the pilot just crosses the "H" off of all the
   signs (the player will probably notice this before being told), and
   it's all good. But then the serial killer gets a can of spray paint
   and suddenly large "H"'s start appearing on the doors. Then we have
   to deal with him for real.

   Why does he have that quirk? Good question. Answer coming at some
   point in the future... probably.
** CONSIDERING Killing on Retainer
   We've got several hired hitman characters. We also have a vague
   government conspiracy. What if each government suit (in the top
   floor of the Ritzy Inn) pays monthly fees to (some of) the
   assassins, so that if they ever need to kill any of their allies
   (for knowing too much or for being disagreeable), then it's easy.
   The net result is a complicated network of several hired guns being
   paid each month by different subsets of the conspiracy, just in
   case anyone needs to be subtly eliminated.
** CONSIDERING Natural History
   A museum... yeah, I haven't really fleshed this one out yet. Maybe
   in other subspace (you know, the place with the headless man's
   head... I don't really think that explanation clears anything up).
   There are some live bears running around the place, and there's an
   area where everything is shrunken down and you have to crawl
   around.

   Maybe Science will visit the place after you free him of his
   bargain. The place guarded by bears (which Science can trivially
   pass through) holds a secret to finding the Console Room?

   I wonder if there's a creepy movie theater in the museum. Maybe a
   hidden chamber off to the side.

   (Possibly related to Prophecy Printing Press below)
** CONSIDERING Nuts
   An organized crime syndicate centered around selling nuts in an
   underground market. As in, literal nuts, like pecans and almonds
   and stuff. Their shtick is that their dialogue is littered with
   nut-themed puns. This could pretty easily tie in with Steve's plot.
   (we still don't know where that Suspicious Briefcase was supposed
   to go)

   Perhaps one of the mobsters is an informant for the government
   (suits at Ritzy Inn, perhaps). He carries around an obvious
   camcorder from the 90s and records everything, yet no one suspects
   him.

   Someone high up in the nut mafia is either a giant insect or some
   kind of sentient plant. Either way, she can shoot poisonous barbs
   from her fingertips.
** CONSIDERING Prophecy Printing Press
   A printing press in subspace (probably Other Subspace, with the
   headless man and the twins). But this is no ordinary printing
   press. The words printed here are written into the very fabric of
   reality and become prophecy. These people literally write
   prophecies which can only be subverted by later prophecies.

   Unfortunately, the device is defunct and has been for many years,
   meaning it's impossible to write new prophecies. The people who
   used to use it are long since gone, and the only prophecies
   remaining are those that are plot-relevant to the game.

   Prophecies
   + Wordsmith

   A few side notes about this. There's probably some old man
   character I haven't fleshed out yet who will take you there and
   explain the point of the place. Or perhaps Science will take you
   there at some point. Ooh, maybe it's in the museum from Natural
   History, as a historical, unfixable artifact that Science takes you
   to see.

   Also, other note. Why can't the Mechanic's Golden Wrench fix it?
   Surely, there's a reason, but we don't want to just gloss over
   that. It's supposedly a wrench that can fix anything. Maybe there's
   a piece missing, that was stolen or lost at some point, and without
   that its prophecies aren't truly prophetic?

   Here's a narrative. Several versions of reality ago, a bunch of
   sociopaths got together, found out how to make this typewriter, and
   started using it to rewrite reality. They didn't make reality
   better, or worse, specifically; they just wanted to tell
   interesting stories about good and evil. They played god with the
   universe for a long time, toying with everyone in it, and then they
   got bored. Bored of their godlike powers, they opted to challenge
   an actual god. They hunted down and encountered the Guardian of
   Time, who promptly wiped them from existence. The typewriter was
   left floating in subspace. Some time later, the Ancient Minister
   found the typewriter (before he had a temple, when he was first
   exploring subspace and discovering the nature of reality). He
   learned of what it had done and what power it held. So he used it
   once more to eliminate it. Using the typewriter, the Minister wrote
   an element out of the periodic table, literally forcing this
   element to have never existed. This element was one required to
   power the typewriter, thereby rendering the device unusable. Since
   then, the device is only an ordinary typewriter, the power source
   that granted it world-altering abilities having been eliminated
   from all of time. Only the Ancient Minister and the Guardian of
   Time himself are aware of these earlier versions of reality and of
   the typewriters true nature. That is, of course, until Science
   Johnson makes his deal. He learns of the typewriter's true origins.
   He eventually takes the player to see the typewriter in the
   subspace museum and explains all of this to the player. In the
   museum, there may be several other prophecies available to view,
   detailing various major stories in the game.
** CONSIDERING Ring of Renewal
   At the beachside resort (Hotel of Seasons), there's a family (or
   maybe just one or two people) standing out staring at the sea in
   all four areas. They never move, and they don't respond if you talk
   to them.

   Somewhere in the resort (possibly not in all four seasons), there's
   someone inside the hotel related to this family. Or possibly some
   old sailor-type character who sees them. He tells of the curse of
   the sea, which occasionally latches onto people who stand by the
   ocean, forcing them into a catatonic state and slowly draining
   their life force. The only cure is the Ring of Renewal, a
   one-of-a-kind artifact lost to time. The Ring, meanwhile, is....
   somewhere. I'm pretty sure I had an idea for where to put it at
   some point, but I forgot. Well, either witch or Starlight is
   probably involved. It'll come to me... maybe.

   Other idea for the Ring of Renewal. Perhaps the inverse world Ring
   of Renewal is genuinely lost to time. But the merfolk in the cavern
   in the /regular/ world have their own Ring of Renewal which works
   just as well.
** CONSIDERING Crystalline Neighborhood
   This all takes place after the Robot King is defeated and the
   inverse city is freed.

   Todd's daughter (or possibly some other small child, but probably
   Todd's daughter) will be standing in the middle of the city,
   holding a magic crystal ball. Someone gave it to her (Not sure who.
   I was originally thinking Trenchcoat Man, but it doesn't fit with
   his story now.) and told her not to drop it. The player can force
   her to drop it (maybe by scaring her, or maybe by simply taking it
   from her). The surrounding area floods with a magical energy, and
   everyone nearby is transported to a strange suburban neighborhood.

   Things in this suburban neighborhood
   + A house that is secretly a temple to the cat gods.
   + Later, a zombie invasion which will force the player and other
     characters into hiding.
   + The Pig King rebellion (See King of Pings below)

   (Side note: If this is a crystal ball, maybe we should change the
   thing Starlight uses to an Orb of Light or something, just so items
   are still unique)

   (I think this one is a Snow Globe now, so Starlight's is fine)
** CONSIDERING Paladin of Dreams
   Let's take Rogue Transport to its logical conclusion. After the bus
   driver was banished from the dream world, the other three ideals
   faded into caricatures, maybe on purpose to prevent another from
   rebelling, or maybe simply because they were missing a crucial
   piece of themselves now.

   As they banished him, they created a paladin: a mighty hero riding
   a dragon who could save them if something ever happened. This hero
   was planted in the human world with no memory of his true purpose.
   If the bus driver were to return, or if something else were to ever
   happen, the dragon buried deep within the earth would arise, find
   the paladin, and awaken his true memories.

   Naturally, something happens. The paladin awakens, eventually finds
   the player, and asks for help. Perhaps he needs help fighting the
   bus driver, or maybe it's about The Letter H guy. The paladin is
   probably married in the human world, and the player can meet his
   wife at some point. He told her what he had to do when he recovered
   his memories, but she doesn't fully understand.

   In the inverse world, the paladin's fate is unfortunately more
   grim. When the Robot King destroyed the dream world, the paladin
   and his dragon both collapsed and died immediately. The paladin's
   wife, in this world, is understandably very confused about what led
   up to his sudden demise.
** CONSIDERING Masked Might
   Somewhere in the forest, there's a man who lives in a mountainside.
   This man was experimented on by some mad scientists (not sure who).
   They gave him super strength, but they gave him far too much super
   strength. He started breaking everything he touched, even when he
   simply walked. The scientists panicked and exploded the lab, hoping
   to trap him inside.

   This man escaped and lived in the forest. His power kept growing,
   so he began to explore the world for a cure to his condition.
   Eventually, he came upon a mystical mask that, as long as he wore
   it, would limit his strength to that of a normal man. So he's been
   living in isolation in his mountain ever since.

   There are a few possible plot points I'm considering with this guy.
   I may combine them, but I'm not sure how yet.
   + Two kids who live nearby find the man and befriend him, coming to
     visit him every once in awhile. Some time later, he disappears
     from existence due to undetermined time travel shenanigans. The
     kids have no memory of him, and the player must recover him
     somehow.
   + His mask is an ancient artifact he stole from the Fighting
     Mummies pyramid, which infuriated the mummies. The player has to
     appease them somehow.
   + It is possible that the two kids mentioned above are from King of
     Pigs. After their parents passed away, they found this man, who
     offered to take them in and raise them. They grew up alongside
     him, until years later when the brother went off to begin his
     martial arts training. If we go with the time travel
     disappearance, then he would probably remain absent through the
     Pig King plot (maybe the Pig King was responsible for his
     disappearance? Unlikely since he doesn't really know he exists).
     If not, then we have to explain why he doesn't just go solve the
     Pig King problem himself, since he's obviously more than capable.
** CONSIDERING Bus Hijacking
   On a bus at some point (probably on the way to Assassination
   Party), three women in cultist outfits briefly hijack the bus and
   steal something important, cutting the thing into three parts. They
   flee to various corners of the earth, and the player must find
   those three objects by hunting the cultists down. Maybe one of the
   assassins (contortionist guy?) are on the bus with the player.

   The object? It could be...
   + Something of value to the bus driver (is this the ideal bus driver, or just /a/ bus driver?)
   + Something of value to the assassin
   + Something the player just got that gets taken from him
   + The bus itself, because why not?
** CONSIDERING Sole Survivors
   There's a family somewhere. They believe that they're the only
   surviving humans in the universe. So, naturally, they launched
   themselves into space to find other life. Then they remembered that
   they hadn't packed any food, so they ordered a pizza. The player
   will somehow end up needing to deliver this pizza, which will
   result in a conversation about the survival of the rest of the
   human race.

   A man is casually shopping at the local store one day, when he
   encounters the Mastermind. The Mastermind is early in his career,
   still working out the quirks of his hypnotism powers, and decides
   to test them out on the man. He tries to hypnotize the man but, in
   the process, the man goes crazy and becomes completely convinced
   that all life on earth is dead. He runs home in a panic, grabs his
   family, steals a spaceship (how did he manage that?!), and flies
   off into space in search for more life. Some time later, his kids
   complain that they're hungry, and he realizes he forgot to pack any
   food. So he uses the telephone on the spaceship to order a pizza.
   At no point does it occur to him that he's ordering a pizza from
   the supposedly extinct planet earth.

   The ship that they're on looks like a spacecraft, but the inside
   looks like an ordinary living room, complete with an old-fashioned
   desk telephone. The only entrance to the craft is an ordinary white
   front door with a doorbell, the sort that you'd find on a house in
   the suburbs. The wife and kids seem surprisingly willing to go
   along with this delusion. The kids might just think it's a game,
   I'm not sure. The wife... maybe she's concerned, or maybe a bit of
   the crazy rubbed off on her.
** CONSIDERING King of Pigs
   Before the start of the game, the Crystalline Neighborhood was
   ruled over by the evil Pig King (who is, naturally, a large bipedal
   talking pig, a little bit bigger than the average adult male). At
   some point, the crystal ball fell into the hands of a pair of kids
   (a brother and a sister). The parents probably got it for the
   sister because it looked like a neat decoration. Somehow, she
   accidentally finds her way into the Crystalline Neighborhood,
   befriends some locals, learns magic, and mounts a rebellion against
   the Pig King, permanently expelling him from the land and cursing
   him to never be able to return. She remains and rules over the
   Neighborhood as its queen, taking care of the land justly.

   The Pig King, expelled from his kingdom, finds himself in the Robot
   King's dominion. He briefly challenges the Robot King before
   finding himself hopelessly outmatched. The Pig King takes the
   crystal ball and (for reasons I haven't decided yet) entrusts it to
   a small child or possibly simply hides it somewhere as he flees
   from the Robot King. He stumbles into the cave and unknowingly
   finds himself in the regular world. Determined to repeat the Robot
   King's success, he hides away in the Ritzy Inn by creating a magic
   floor that can only be visited by some special means, where he
   begins kidnapping poor hapless individuals and experimenting with
   mind control on them.

   Meanwhile, in the regular world, the two siblings are... I haven't
   fully decided yet. It's possible they're orphans, or maybe not.
   Either way, they're high school age. The brother has been off
   training with a master martial artist and fighting some vaguely
   evil force (we may do a separate bullet point on him too). He comes
   back into town for his sister's graduation, but he gets taken by
   the Pig King. The Pig King captures the brother and starts working
   on him, putting him into a deep trance. When he doesn't show up,
   his sister goes looking for him and stumbles upon the Pig King's
   secret floor. He recognizes her from the other world and swears
   vengeance upon who he believes is the queen, resulting in a battle
   between the two siblings and the Pig King.

   "King of Pigs" doesn't quite roll off the tongue. What about
   "Swinelord"?
** CONSIDERING King of the Hospital
   So there's a hospital somewhere (in the airport, Ritzy Inn, Hotel
   of Seasons, the tower, somewhere?). Some main-ish character ends up
   in the hospital due to unrelated events. When the player goes to
   visit, he finds that the people there are being infected by an
   ancient classical king (Related to Atheena? Related to Fighting
   Mummies?) whose touch drains the life of the victim. Some of the
   members of the hospital have formed an impromptu detective group to
   investigate the events, during which time they end up finding this
   king. To get him to stop, they have to satisfy some request (again,
   possibly related to Fighting Mummies).

   The man who founded the detective group is a brilliant inventor
   (either Arthur Miles or someone who is friends with Arthur Miles).
   When the king finds himself getting investigated, he starts to form
   a cult which ends up killing the founder of the group.

   (Does the geology club join this detective group? Honestly, it
   seems like something they'd be interested in and good at, if it's
   happening in their dimension) (Maybe not; they might be a candidate
   for the /other/ side of the Calamity Coin)
** CONSIDERING Faraway Mine
   On one of the planets in space, there's a mine where aliens
   (perhaps the same aliens as the ones on the moon, perhaps not) are
   forced to work by some other aliens (not the same as the ones on
   the moon). The player winds up near there or possibly made to work
   at the mine and must liberate them.
** CONSIDERING Conspiracy in a Truck
   Okay, this one is /really/ not fleshed out at all. But basically,
   at some point the player is investigating (probably for the
   government) what's going on with an association probably either
   directly or indirectly related to Grigory's shtick. In doing so,
   the player ends up in an armored truck, where one of the
   conspirators reveals themselves to be a giant fungus monster (see
   below, believe it or not: Forces of Nature) and kills the player.
   The player has to find some immunity to this.
** CONSIDERING Forces of Nature
   Shortly after the earth formed into something resembling a planet,
   three abstract forces of nature came into being: the Animal, the
   Plant, and the Fungus. These three forces of nature protected their
   respective domains and helped them grow for a time, and they
   coexisted in peace. Then the Animal became experimental. He took
   human form and granted humankind intelligence. This infuriated the
   Plant and the Fungus (who are intelligent but biologically cannot
   speak), and the two declared war.

   Fast-forward to the prehistoric era. The war is still raging, and
   the Plant and Fungus have announced their explicit intention to
   wipe out all of humanity. The player encounters the Animal and
   helps him to repel the other two. In the climax, the Animal uses
   all of his power to launch the Plant into space. The Plant winds up
   on the moon, where it remains until it is probably destroyed by the
   Fence's laser in the present day. The Fungus flees in a panic at
   seeing the Animal's true power. The Animal, having exhausted his
   power, lay dying, and as a final gift to humanity grants the player
   his power to resist the Fungus' infection powers.

   Fast-forward once again to the present day. The Fungus has assumed
   human form and infiltrated humanity to identify their weaknesses.
   Eventually, there's a climax in an armored truck (see Conspiracy in
   a Truck). The only way the player can win this fight is with the
   Animal's resistance.
** CONSIDERING Alien Apocalypse
   On one of the several alien planets the player will visit, there
   are three divine siblings: the Evil Eye, the Great Gown, and the
   Beast of End. The Beast of End has awoken from its long slumber
   and, according to legend, will destroy the planet now that it's
   awake. The player, along with the Evil Eye and the Great Gown, must
   appease the Beast of End and put it back to sleep.

   More expansion on this. Millions of years ago, an ancient alien
   warrior race did battle with a giant immortal beast that had eaten
   countless planets before. After many years, they couldn't defeat
   the beast altogether and had only managed to remove one of its
   eyes, so they sealed it away. Using their advanced technology, they
   trapped the beast in a parallel dimension, using a giant spinning
   coin as the lock. The coin was placed on a planet that was, at the
   time, unpopulated. They took the beast's eye and animated it. The
   eye was left on the planet alongside the coin, to guard it for all
   eternity.

   The coin used life itself to keep the seal powered. On each side of
   the coin is an entire world (King of the Hospital on one side, and
   The Mayor's Tyranny on the other). One world is always at peace and
   the other is always in despair. When the coins flip, the worlds'
   roles flip. At present, the King of the Hospital world is on top
   and (thanks to the Plague King) will soon reverse, while The
   Mayor's Tyranny is on the bottom and (thanks to a future revolt)
   will soon reverse.

   Many years later, an alien species wound up settling on this
   planet, unaware of the eye, the coin, or the beast. The coin, when
   it spins, causes massive earthquakes, so the locals dubbed it the
   Calamity Coin. During the quakes, they would hear roars from the
   Beast of End as it tried to escape. All attempts by the locals to
   approach the Coin were thwarted by the eye, who sent them away
   unharmed. As such, they began to refer to the eye as the Evil Eye.
   Due to a quirk in the Eye's design, it can only communicate with
   people who have been to both sides of the coin. As such, it will be
   unable to communicate with the player until then.

   Naturally, the player will help both sides of the coin. For the
   tyrant, this poses no issues, as the tyrant's reign was at an end.
   But for the Plague King, his rise was meant to be inevitable, and
   his premature defeat will upset the balance of the Coin and allow
   the Beast to escape. The Evil Eye will realize his true role as an
   eye of the Beast itself and use its power to slow the Beast's
   rampage until the player can find a permanent way to defeat the
   Beast.

   The Man in the Black Mask is a lesser god, capable of manipulating
   things around him but not of altering reality itself. He created
   the Beast of End in an experiment a long time ago and immediately
   regretted it. He had no power to defeat his creation, so he ran
   away to Higher Subspace and lived in self-exile. After the player
   encounters him in Higher Subspace, he'll flee once again to a
   deserted planet somewhere in space. To defeat the Beast, the player
   might need the Man in the Black Mask's help or a clue from him.
   (Note: The Black Mask may or may not be related to the Masked Might
   mask; did the Man use it to contain his own powers and make sure he
   doesn't create another Beast?)

   (Is the Flaming Axe of Death the only thing capable of defeating
   the Beast of End?)
** CONSIDERING The Minister's Demon
   Many years ago, the Ancient Minister (when he wasn't quite so
   ancient) was an adventurer, traveling through time and space saving
   lives and helping people. At one point, he met a young boy whose
   parents had been killed, and he took the boy under his wing,
   raising him as his own. At the boy's repeated insistence, he agreed
   to start training the boy as his pupil, so that he could become an
   adventurer too.

   Many years later, the pupil had grown into a man, and the two had
   many adventures together. One day, a powerful demon appeared
   suddenly on earth, as if from nowhere at all. This demon took the
   form of a giant black monster, roughly the size of a skyscraper,
   with horns and wings, and ravaged the landscape. The Minister and
   his pupil stepped in, fighting the demon but finding him too
   powerful to kill. After conventional methods of sealing the demon
   away failed, the Minister concocted a plan. He would imprison the
   demon in his own body and exile himself to a faraway land. His body
   would act as a prison, and the demon would be unable to escape
   provided the Minister never lost control of his emotions. The
   Minister set up the trap, and everything was ready. But his pupil
   refused to sit idly by. He believed the Minister was meant to do
   more good for the world, so he took the Minister's place and sealed
   the demon in his own body instead.

   The pupil exiled himself to an island (possibly the warehouse
   island? Or possibly another planet?). For ten long years, he and
   the demon were in a constant struggle that always ended in a
   stalemate. Then the demon got crafty. He reversed the pupil's aging
   process, forcing him to get younger instead of older, reasoning
   that if he could age the pupil out of existence, his prison would
   be no more. The pupil had no defense against this and requested one
   final favor of the Minister. He chose to live out his remaining
   childhood on the island in peace, and when he was a baby again, the
   Minister was to seal him away, freezing his body in time and the
   demon with him. The Minister obliged, and he sealed the baby in a
   stasis chamber beneath his temple. The player will learn all of
   this from Matthew when he finds the baby underneath the temple.

   Sometime after the player discovers this, an angry old man (who?)
   gets wind of the baby and its power, breaks into the subspace
   temple, and eats the baby, thereby acquiring the demon's power. The
   Minister, whose power has waned greatly since his first battle with
   the demon, sends the old man into deep space to stall for time. The
   man makes it back to earth and uses his newfound demonic powers,
   first to make himself younger, then to exact revenge on old
   enemies, and finally to carry out the most petty of grudges.
   Eventually, his anger consumes him, and the demon escapes, using
   the old man's life force to assume his original demonic form and
   continue his rampage.

   Then... what? Maybe he faces off against the Headless Man in his
   mech suit, and the two wipe each other out? Maybe not?
** CONSIDERING The Minister's Origin
   The Minister started his adventure and began learning about time
   travel because someone close to him was erased from history due to
   a time travel accident. I'm not sure who it was, and the Minister
   probably remembers the previous timeline due to a natural affinity
   for time-related abilities. This will need some expansion.
** CONSIDERING Groceries
   Elaborating on the grocery store from The Prehistoric Maze a bit.
   Maybe the store itself exists as part of Alien Apocalypse's
   hospital side of the coin (i.e. across the street from the
   hospital) and the version in The Prehistoric Maze is a revisit to
   the area.

   In the "original" one in the hospital world, there's a strange man
   trying to sell ancient Egyptian artifacts to you. May tie into
   Fighting Mummies or Masked Might somehow. Maybe he's selling a
   magic sword that can cut through anything?

   Also, there's two guys who have gotten into a dispute over a woman.
   They both have special flame powers and are ready to go nuclear in
   a fight that the player has to break up.

   In one of the aisles of the grocery store, there are floating
   paintbrushes painting all of the merchandise, and for that matter
   all of the people, solid black. Any attempts to stop the brushes
   are ineffectual. In the back room, the player will find a genie in
   a lamp, who admits that they are painting the whole place black
   after a small child wished for it.
** CONSIDERING Shifty Mischief
   There's a trickster (probably a demigod or something) causing
   mayhem. Eventually, some government types caught him and were
   taking him into custody. Unfortunately, they wound up getting
   routed through the Hotel of Seasons. In the Hotel, he repeatedly
   evades capture using his magic tricks and is later recaptured. The
   player must capture him and secure him in order to break the cycle.
** CONSIDERING Catching Heat
   There's a stadium in the Hotel of Seasons. There's this guy who,
   whenever you get near him, is obnoxious and attacks you in various
   ways. A few feet away, there's a cop who refuses to get involved
   unless he /sees/ the crime happen. You have to trick the guy into
   attacking you in plain view of the cop in order to get him in
   trouble.

   Perhaps the cop is our favorite mustached prison security guard?
   Fits with his character.
** CONSIDERING Garden at the Top
   There's a kind old woman tending a garden at the top of the Inverse
   Tower. She doesn't trust you if you come up the elevator the
   "regular" way, so you have to come up the interior elevator for her
   to trust you.

   She's Todd's mother. When the Robot King took over, Todd hid his
   mother and daughter in the Inverse Tower to keep them safe from the
   Robot King's influence, and it seems to have actually worked.
** CONSIDERING The Mayor's Tyranny
   On one side of the Calamity Coin, an evil tyrant rules a dystopian
   future.

   Here's the long and short of it. Mostly the long. Several years ago
   (last time this side of the Coin was face-down), an unnamed evil
   tyrant ruled over the city with an iron fist. The geology club
   (Topaz, Garnet, and Zircon) banded together and overthrew this
   tyrant, establishing democracy once and for all.

   The democracy lasted several years (the duration of the Calamity
   Coin's face-up time), but then the Mayor appeared. The Mayor is a
   demagogue who ran for office and then seized control of the
   election and all bodies of government. To ensure that the geology
   club couldn't stop him, he released a special rage-inducing fungus
   into their water supply, turning them against each other in a
   drug-fueled fury.

   The Mayor takes over the city. The geology club disbands, and its
   three members go their separate ways. Zircon finds himself in a fit
   of paranoia and lines his entire house with deadly, explosive
   traps. Garnet finds herself lonely and begins building robots to
   keep her company. Topaz is intensely focused and discovers that
   they've been treated with a fungus. He discovers an antidote
   formula but requires Zircon's chemistry knowledge to mix it. Topaz
   goes to visit Zircon, and an altercation ensues, ending in the two
   former friends limping away from the explosive battleground.

   Some time later, the player finds this world. If he visits Zircon
   or Garnet first, they'll simply kill him. If he visits Topaz, he'll
   fill the player in on what's happened. The player must befriend
   Zircon and get his help. Zircon, then, will need a couple of
   ingredients. One of them will be easy (maybe the Crone in the
   inverse world will sell it). The other is only available at a black
   market store and requires Garnet's knowledge of criminal technology
   to buy. The player will befriend Garnet as well and get the group
   back together, creating the antidote and curing them all.

   Shortly thereafter, Garnet will hack into the Mayor's computers and
   send his secret police away. Zircon will blow up his panic bunker.
   And Topaz will publicly expose the Mayor and run against him in the
   next election, thereby ending the tyranny and completing the turn
   of the Calamity Coin.
** CONSIDERING The Serpent's Prison
   There is a hole in the ground somewhere. This hole has existed for
   all of eternity. Either it moves around, or it's simply magical
   enough that most people don't notice it. Any attempt to use a
   ladder or other tool to get down into it will result in the victim
   falling in without their ladder.

   The hole itself is a large black void with no lights, and the only
   features are the skeletons of previous victims. The hole keeps its
   victim alive. When a prisoner is hungry, there is miraculously a
   piece of bread in the corner. When thirsty, the troughs will be
   full of water. There is a staircase on the opposite side of the
   wall that leads out of the prison and back to the normal world.
   Unfortunately, an immortal Serpent sleeps by the staircase and
   awakens to attack anyone who approaches, rendering the prison
   inescapable.

   At some point, the player notices the hole in the city (or perhaps
   the hole /moves/ to the city) and falls in. There are two people in
   it. One is younger, fell in recently, and doesn't fully understand
   what's happening (he might even be someone we meet in the overworld
   before he falls in). The other is a slightly older scholarly
   gentleman and has been studying the Serpent's prison his entire
   life. He knows its history and is happy to provide narrative. (The
   latter character might be at Evil Club at first)

   Thousands of years ago (i.e. in prehistory), the hole also exists
   somewhere. A dashing rogue fell into the hole. He tried to kill the
   Serpent but discovered its immortality quickly, when the Serpent
   resurrected itself and bit off his right hand. Sure enough, the
   prison's magic provided him with the necessary bandages to stay
   alive.

   Now, the scholarly gentleman in the present day has heard about the
   dashing rogue. The scholarly gentleman tells the player that the
   dashing rogue stunned the Serpent with a silver dagger tipped in a
   special poison and suggests that they could use something similar
   to escape. Being a scholar, he has studied the dashing rogue's
   notes and knows how to make the poison. He gives the player the
   instructions.

   The player returns to prehistory and suggests the poisoned dagger
   to the rogue. The rogue takes to the idea but laments that he has
   neither poison nor dagger. The player must collect a silver dagger
   (whereabouts unknown) and concoct the poison (sounds like something
   that Zircon of The Mayor's Tyranny could help with). He uses this
   poison to save both the rogue, as well as the scholarly gentleman
   and his friend.
** CONSIDERING The Pink Locker
   Probably at the Hotel of Seasons, though it doesn't have to be.
   There's a young girl on a beach with a pink locker (like the kind
   of locker you find in a high school) that she guards. Separately,
   at the Hotel, there's an antigravity machine made by... somebody.
   Turning the antigravity machine on causes her and her locker (and
   probably everybody else in the Hotel) to float up. This persists at
   least until the player dies, maybe even until the player makes it
   back to turn the device off (the effect is localized to the Hotel,
   but it carries across the seasons freely).

   The girl will be upset after you turn it on and off once, because
   you destroyed her locker. She'll bicycle up to the room the machine
   is on. (Using a bike that can fly? Go figure. Not even on the top
   ten list of weirdest unexplained things in this game) She'll demand
   a new locker. The player has to get a new locker for her somehow.
   Probably involves stealing one from the Reeducation school and
   getting the Postman to ship it to her. Also, it needs to be painted
   pink. Where are we going to get spray paint?
** CONSIDERING The Engineer
   The Mechanic from the inverse world is a mad scientist who calls
   himself the Engineer. He doesn't work for the Robot King. He's
   running his own evil empire where he experiments with cybernetic
   modifications to the human body. He eventually plans to lead an
   army of cyborgs /against/ the Robot King.

   Where is the Engineer stationed? I could see him fitting well in a
   hidden area of the dream world airport. Probably not Hotel of
   Seasons (just doesn't feel right).
** CONSIDERING Legacy of the Clouds
   The Cloud People are extinct, naturally. Their own Thundercloud
   prophecy ended their kind in prehistory. However, one young Cloud
   Person resisted the end of their race, falling to earth and
   drinking ocean water to keep his body's composure. He kept himself
   alive over the years by drinking gallons of water every day and
   mainly kept to himself, laying low by the seaside.

   Over the years, as humanity advanced and the quality and purity of
   ocean water diminished, he started to change color, his billowy
   white turning an awkward green-blue shade. Eventually, his demeanor
   begins to suffer as well, shifting gradually from a friendly
   wanderer to a disgruntled old man to a radical revenge-seeker. He
   learns to channel the impurities in the water into his right hand,
   forming a sort of makeshift gun that fires a potent acid, and he
   begins using it to take out humans he deems as impure.

   Naturally, the police (or military, or one of the many paramilitary
   groups this game seems to have) get involved and corner him in...
   some kind of large mansion? They can't get too close to him,
   because of his acid gun that eats through any defenses they can
   muster. The player shows up and is asked to reason with him. The
   player can't reason with him until after he's personally completed
   the Cloud People's prophecy (see Cloud World above). After that,
   the last Cloud Person cries out that his kind died so that humanity
   could live and that his body is proof that humanity is corrupt. The
   player must talk him down and then take him to the museum, where he
   can see that the legacy of his people is remembered fondly and that
   he is not forgotten. The last Cloud Person, seeing this, will
   choose to die in peace.
** CONSIDERING Election Season
   In the regular city, the mayor is, to put it mildly, rather dull.
   He's not very bright, and he's regularly manipulated by all manner
   of external interests, most namely the prison warden. The warden of
   the prison is the real leader of the city behind the scenes,
   manipulating the mayor at every turn. Up till now, the warden has
   been strategically bribing or bullying any political opponents into
   submission, allowing his pawn to remain in power. It's election
   season now!

   There's a mermaid (from the merfolk kingdom) running against the
   mayor this time. She seeks to improve relations between her kind
   and humanity. She also won't accept bribes from the warden. Nobody
   knows she's a mermaid (save for the warden, who has done his
   homework, and a key group of aides who are in on the masquerade),
   and she's been strategically only appearing behind walls or in
   camera shots from the chest up, in order to hide her fin. The
   warden is finding ever more creative ways to try to eliminate her.
   At some point, the player will get caught in the crossfire and end
   up helping her. Together, the two will expose the warden for who he
   really is.
** CONSIDERING Arctic Demons
   Near the south pole, a high level of demonic activity has caused
   problems in the past. To remedy the situation, the government set
   up a base around the problem area and leaves two trained
   professionals to guard it at all times, exorcising any threats that
   approach.

   At the moment, two folks, a man and a woman, are stationed there.
   Unfortunately, and by sheer coincidence, two demons have
   simultaneously possessed the two people, without being aware of one
   another. The player will eventually arrive and find these two
   demons trying to fool each other into believing that they're human.

   These demons might be related to The Minister's Demon above.
** CONSIDERING A Peaceful Cruise
   In addition to the Captain's ship, at some point a cruise ship will
   dock on the warehouse island. To board the cruise ship, the player
   must have a ticket, which can be obtained... somehow (???). Once
   boarded, the ship goes out to sea.

   If the player dies, sleeps, or otherwise leaves the ship, he can
   return to it by asking the Captain to go there. The Captain will be
   able to go to the cruise ship, like he can the other destinations
   (including the pirate ship).

   On the ship, someone will fairly quickly be murdered. The player
   will have to solve the murder and capture whoever did it.

   Passengers
   + The player
   + The murder victim (details???)
   + The Plumber (the Mechanic's younger brother; plumbing is a very
     lucrative career in this world)
   + The two young women from Contraband (see below)
   + Someone from Evil Club (???)
** CONSIDERING Contraband
   Two young women work for the Nuts mafia. They smuggle nuts from
   Merchant-bot's warehouse to the mainland using the cruise ship
   (from A Peaceful Cruise).

   The first woman, Victoria, is quiet. She's deeply invested in the
   mafia business (maybe she knows the leader personally, or maybe her
   family was involved?). For unknown reasons, she has the useful
   ability to walk on water.

   The second woman, Cherry, is more vocal. She's Victoria's childhood
   friend, and the only person she really confides in. She is less
   directly involved in the mafia business and only does it to help
   her friend (this might be her first time being involved). She has a
   quirk that she hasn't discovered yet, where objects will be
   duplicated on her person at random. Specifically, if she places
   something in her pocket, sometimes she'll reach in later and find
   two copies of the same thing.

   The mafia has funded Cherry's ticket on the cruise ship. She boards
   the ship like an ordinary passenger and checks into her room. Then
   Victoria takes a briefcase full of nuts and walks it out to the
   ship once it's a short way out at sea, delivering it to Cherry.
   Victoria has done this many times, but it's Cherry's first time
   being involved in the operation (Victoria previously did it with
   relative strangers).

   The player will likely stumble upon Victoria and Cherry making the
   exchange, some time after the murder occurs.
** CONSIDERING Pasttime Prison
   If you turn yourself into the cops in the past, you go to jail for
   the day and await trial that night. If you do nothing and simply
   wait, then you go to trial the following night as though you turned
   yourself in at night. But you can try to escape (??)

   Basically, just make "turn yourself in in the past" more
   interesting than "awkward way to get to subspace".
** CONSIDERING Clandestine Affairs
   A secret cabal meets regularly at different locations to discuss
   their affairs. Each meeting is in a different place, and when
   they're done with their meeting, they throw a grenade at the
   meeting spot to destroy any evidence. The player will keep
   accidentally happening upon their various meeting spots.

   (Do they meet in the Traveling Circus? Is that their cover?)
** CONSIDERING Going Viral
   An organization (maybe the government, maybe the group from
   Clandestine Affairs) has acquired a dangerous machine from a
   foreign intelligence agency. This machine, if connected to the Web,
   will spread a computer virus the likes of which the world has never
   known. They seek to hide it away and keep it safe.

   A man who can shoot pulses of sound waves from his hands hears
   about it and tries to take the machine for himself.
** CONSIDERING Resurrection at the Church
   There's a church or some other kind of religious temple. They're
   sacrificing a young woman in order to resurrect an evil demon.

   Meanwhile, another woman is taking a hot air balloon voyage to an
   ancient temple (perhaps Masked Might's temple?), where she seeks an
   artifact with the power to reverse time. She wants to use it to go
   back and stop something bad from happening to her family. She
   acquires the artifact and is ballooning back home.

   The demon is resurrected successfully and grows to a massive size,
   destroying the church in the process and shrouding the sun,
   covering the land in darkness. The ballooning woman is flying by at
   the time, and the chaos causes her to fall to the ground. The
   artifact activates and jumps time back 24 hours, giving the player
   time to preemptively rescue the sacrificed girl.
** CONSIDERING Frozen Castle
   There's a castle made of solid ice at the south pole. The castle is
   abandoned and is structured like a maze. It houses the finest ice
   cubes in the land: cubes of ice that will literally never melt.
   Unfortunately, this treasure is hidden in a secret room that can
   only be reached with... something? Subspace map? Or something else?
** CONSIDERING Endless Opera
   This is probably in the Hotel of Seasons. There are two sisters
   sitting and watching an opera, when the eldest sister is suddenly
   killed. The killer escapes before anyone can ID them.

   Since this is in the Hotel of Seasons, the event is forced to
   repeat. For some reason, the younger sister and the killer seem to
   become aware of the repetition, unlike most of the Hotel's other
   inhabitants. The two continually one-up each other over the
   seasons, one trying to complete her job and the other trying to
   stop her. This culminates in a battle on a balcony, where the
   player must help the younger sister win.

   Why is the older sister being targeted? Is she involved in some
   clandestine activity? Or was it collateral damage and someone else
   was the true target?
** CONSIDERING The Water Supply
   There's a big water tower somewhere. I don't know if it's
   somewhere, or everywhere, or outside of spacetime, or underwater.
   All of those make equal amounts of sense in this game (though I do
   love the irony of a water tower underwater). The player will end up
   inside of it at several points, and there are also some other
   people in there. Once inside, the player has nowhere to go and the
   only option is to fall asleep. If the water level is low enough,
   this takes the player to the train. If it's high enough, it results
   in the player's death.

   The water level starts completely empty and will rise to full over
   the course of the game. Might be triggered by muffins, might be by
   Butler events, or maybe something else. But something happens when
   it gets full.

   (Is the water tower the dream world of the Calamity Coin?)
** CONSIDERING The Fractal Dimension
   One of the places you can crash into in space is a fractal prison.
   It looks just like the regular prison, at least as far as the
   prison gates and hallways are concerned. The four exits from the
   hallways lead to self-similar deeper prisons just like it. You can
   go arbitrarily deep like this.

   Once you go three layers deep, there will be a bed in the outside
   area at all times which you can use to sleep and escape.

   There is a "correct" path through the fractal dimension. The
   correct path is constant and is about three layers deep. Following
   the correct path leads to a small white chamber with a muffin.
   After collecting the muffin, the player falls asleep automatically,
   similar to the underworld abyss.

   The correct path is indicated by a large sign left by a stranger in
   the museum (see Natural History above).
** CONSIDERING Observing your Doom
   I imagine this happening on the hospital side of the Calamity Coin,
   though I'm not totally married to that if something better comes
   along. Also, there might be a portal to this place from the
   abandoned school of witches.

   In this world, June and Julie were abducted just as usual, but when
   they got back to earth, they came to terms with their powers and
   became sort of local superheroes. June is... somewhere. She might
   be at the hospital, or she might be in a faraway land somewhere.
   Julie is with a tour group of an ancient observatory, when the
   witch attacks. The witch seals the observatory and turns the
   interior into a labyrinth, trapping everyone inside and slowly
   draining their life force. Julie, of course, assumes her superhero
   identity and fights back.

   She calls herself Lucky Lass. What is June's super name?
** CONSIDERING Sliding All the Way Down
   There's a water slide somewhere. It connects various sites around
   the multiverse. You can slide /down/ the water slide but not back
   up it. The water slide originates... somewhere, and it eventually
   lets out in the main city hub... or perhaps it lets out at the
   prison river?

   The water slide does not exist until summoned. To summon it, you
   have to go to where the slide starts at the very top and hit a
   "water slide" button.

   Possible locations the slide could visit:
   + The river at the prison
   + The main city hub area
   + The hotel of seasons in summer (it can also be accessed in most
     seasons but is frozen in winter)

** The Butler
   This section is an attempt to summarize all of the Butler events
   and the things directly triggered by them.
*** Butler 0
    The game begins in this state. The Butler will appear in the
    player's prison cell when all of the following conditions have
    been met.
    + The player has just been arrested and moved to the prison.
    + The player has been arrested before (~been-to-prison~).
    + The player has at least one item. (Note that muffins do not
      count as items)
    Obviously, since Butler 0 is the starting state of the game, it
    does not directly trigger any subplots or quests.
*** Butler 1
    The player has at least reasonably explored some portion of the
    starting area. When the game moves to Butler 1, the following
    opportunities are directly made available by this trigger.
    + The Butler's gift to the player is information on how to get to
      the science lab beneath the Ritzy Inn, which opens up the past
      city and subspace.
    + Silver Starlight will appear at the cottage.
    + Harry will ask the player to help him escape from prison.

    The Butler will appear in the (present-day) pawn shop when all of
    the following conditions are met.
    + The player has just entered the pawn shop in the present day.
    + The player has talked to Dr. Louis (~talked-to-louis~).
    + The player has jumped into the fire pits in the underworld (~jumped-into-fire~).
*** Butler 2
    The player has been to the science lab in the Ritzy Inn basement
    and has been to the underworld at least once. When the game moves
    to Butler 2, the following are made available.
    + The Butler gives the player the Fireproof Suit, which opens up
      the warehouse island area.
    + Dr. Cipher will allow the player to initiate the Necromancy
      Certificate quest.
    + The ship's captain in the dream world will appear by the dock.
    + The Hatman will appear in the cottage basement.

    The Butler will move to Shabby Jack's Streetside Motel in the
    past when the following conditions are met.
    + The player has just entered Shabby Jack's in the past.
    + The player has the Soul Crystal.
    + The player has read the note on the warehouse wall
      (~merchant-war~ is not ~no~).
    + The player has initiated discussion with Attorney-Man on the
      island (~attorney-man~ is ~talked1~ or beyond).
*** Butler 3
    By this point, the player has initiated three of the major
    early-game quests: Attorney-Man, the Merchant-bot war, and Johnny
    Death. When the game moves to Butler 3, the following become
    available.
    + The Butler gives the player the Crystal Ball, which allows the
      player to proceed on Silver Starlight's Pastel Town quest.
    + The Reaper will now allow the player to recover the cursed chest
      from the Ancient Minister.
** Next
   +Mothka's execution chamber should take you to the other room.+
