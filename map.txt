-------- EVENTS --------

1. Robbery Event (city-thug)
  (*) no
      After the first visit to the Shady Alley, the player will be told that someone is watching them.
      The game proceeds to state `stalking`.
  (*) stalking
      If he goes to the police station, he will have the option of telling the police he is being
      followed, resulting in state `chasing`. If the player goes to the shopping or hotel districts,
      then the robber leaps out and strikes, pointing a gun in the player's face and demanding money.
      The player can cooperate (if they actually have money), refuse, or claim to have none.
      - Cooperate - The player gives up either a silver coin or a platinum credit card and the robber
        runs off. The game moves to state `island`.
      - Claim (truthfully) - If the player truthfully has no money, the robber will let him go and
        return to state `no`.
      - Claim (falsely) - The robber will call the player on his lie and act as though he refused.
      - Refuse - The player will be shot and will go to Underworld. The robber will go hide out on
        Dream Train to avoid the police. Move to state `hiding`.
  (*) chasing ////
      The robber will keep a low profile and will not be able to be found. In this state, the Shady
      Alley will reveal a silver coin.
      //// Something should reset the Robbery Event
  (*) island
      The robber will end up on the Warehouse island. The player can talk to him. The robber will
      say that he ended up not needing the player's money and will return whatever he stole
      (stolen-good). He will then leave and the game will revert to `no`. Alternatively, telling
      the police will result in the `hunted` state.
  (*) hiding ////
      The robber will be on the Dream Train. The player can talk to him, where he will apologize for
      shooting the player and claim that it was "just business". The game then moves to `no` as the
      robber leaves the train.
      //// What then?
  (*) hunted
      The robber will be caught and moved to the dining hall in the prison. If the player talks to
      him, the game moves to `caught`.
  (*) caught
      If the player talks to the police (with a clean criminal record, according to the Trial Event),
      they will present him with the stolen good he lost. If the Platinum Card has not been obtained
      (thug-card), they will also present him with that, and he will be asked to choose which one was
      his. After doing so, the game reverts to `no`.

2. Trial Event (trial-crime)
  (*) no
      The player has not been arrested. When the player is arrested for confessing to murder, the
      game will go to state `court`, trial-reason will go to state `murder`, and the player is
      moved to the courtroom, where the trial will proceed. If the player should end up in
      prison in this state, he can speak to the warden, who will promptly release him with an
      apology.
      //// Warden stuff is not in the game right now
  (*) court
      The player is given the option to plead guilty or innocent. If he pleads guilty, he is
      convicted. If he pleads innocent and lacks a lawyer, he will be convicted anyway. In the case of
      conviction, the game moves to `prison` and the player is moved to prison. Once again, if the
      player ends up in prison, the warden will happily release him. Alternatively, he can use Dr.
      Cipher in the Underworld to reset this state to `no`.
      //// Lawyer?
  (*) prison
      In this state, if the player moves to the police station, he will be apprehended and tried in
      court, moving back to state `court`. If the player visits Dr. Cipher, his Document
      Transmogrifier will reset this to `no`.
      //// Lawyer?

3. Gate Guard Event (prison-guard)
  (*) no
      The prison guard stands at the gate. The player can talk to him and bribe the guard with a
      Silver Coin, releasing the player back to the city and moving to `paid`. Note that even though
      the player has been freed from prison, he does not have a clean record and will be arrested on
      sight if he returns to the police station.
  (*) paid ////
      If the player ends up in prison again, the guard will still be there. He will initially resist
      releasing the player but will relent when reminded of the bribe. The player is released and the
      game moves to `fired`.
  (*) fired ////
      The third time the player is in prison, there will be a female guard in place of the original
      guard. She will not be amenable to bribes and will not release the player. When the player
      speaks to her, the game moves to `search`.
  (*) search
      //// Where is the guard? We need to find him and give him a lawyer

4. Johnny Death Event (johnny-quest)
  (*) no
      Johnny Death is in the Underworld balcony and is seeking souls for his display case. When the
      player encounters him, he will ask for help stealing souls for his display. If the player
      accepts, he will be given the Soul Crystal and the Elevator Access Key so that he can exit
      the Underworld. The game moves to `accepted`.
  (*) accepted
      Johnny is waiting to receive souls from the player. The souls that are available are in
      the prison exercise fields (exercise-soul), ... ////
      When the first soul is brought to him, Johnny will tell the player about Dr. Cipher's invention
      //// Rewards the player with each advanced state
  (*) 1 ////
  (*) 2 ////
  (*) done ////

5. The Butler's Event (butler-game)
  (*) no
      The butler is nowhere to be found. The game will move from this state to `cell` when
      the following three conditions are met.
      - The player has just been arrested and moved to the prison.
      - The player has been arrested before (been-to-prison).
      - The player has at least one item.
  (*) cell
      The butler is in the player's prison cell. When he talks to him, he will tell the player
      about the science lab and how to get to it. The game will move from this state to `pawn`
      when the following three conditions are met.
      - The player has just entered the pawn shop in the present.
      - The player has talked to Dr. Louis (talked-to-louis).
      - The player has jumped into the fire pits (jumped-into-fire).
  (*) pawn
      The butler is in the pawn shop in the present. When he talks to him, he will give the
      player a Fireproof Suit.
      //// Next state

a. Shady Alley Silver Coin (sa-coin)
  (*) no
      The coin has not been collected. It will only show itself if city-thug is `chasing`. When
      collected, the game moves to `yes`.
  (*) yes
      The coin has been collected. It will not show itself.

b. River Treasures (forest-river)
  (*) 0
      The river has not been explored yet. Exploring the river will give a Silver Coin and move to `1`.
  (*) 1
      Exploring the river in this state will not yield anything but will move to `2`.
  (*) 2
      Exploring the river in this state will yield the Maple Muffin and move to `3`.
  (*) 3
      Nothing of use comes from exploring the river in this state.

c. Exercise Field Soul (exercise-soul)
  (*) no
      The soul has not been collected. Talking to the exercise field inmate will result in the player
      being killed unless he backs off. If the player has the Soul Crystal, he can claim his soul,
      giving him {Inmate's Soul} and moving to `yes`.
  (*) yes
      The inmate's soul has been taken. Talking to him will result in a rather depressed response and
      nothing of interest happening.

d. Second Class Muffin (muffin-second)
  (*) no
      The muffin has not been collected yet. It will be available in the 2nd class car of the dream
      train, but only after the train has reached its destination of the big city. Collecting it
      moves to state `yes`.
  (*) yes
      The muffin has been collected and will not appear again.

e. Dr. Louis Introduction (talked-to-louis)
  (*) no
      The player has not spoken to Dr. Louis. When he does so, she will introduce herself and give him
      the Club Key. The game will then move to `yes`.
  (*) yes
      The player has spoken to Dr. Louis.

e. Freight Elevator Coin (fe-coin)
  (*) no
      The coin is not available yet. When the player visits the west edge of the warehouse,
      the game will move to `exists`.
  (*) exists
      The coin exists in the freight elevator and can be collected. When collected, the game
      moves to `yes`.
  (*) yes
      The coin has been collected and will not appear again.

TEST:
 * Johnny Death, start to finish (by hacking in the soul items)

NOTES:
 * Cave will lead somewhere cool if you have a light (inverse city)
 * Given gift if falsely imprisoned (according to Warden), maybe Religious Artifact
 * -- Shrinking item but requires certain power port (purple outlets) to use --
 * -- On the opposite side of the narrow tunnel in the Underworld (accessible with shrinking item), you can access the secret elevator which goes to the warehouse island --
 * Past the fire pits, there should be multiple rooms which are accessible, not just the freight elevator
 * Attorney-Man and the three clients (player, guard, and robber)
 * Merchant-bot has two items (one at a ridiculous price); there is a quest to kill him, which leads to the warehouse office. At that time, Merchant-bot 2 takes over and sells the expensive one for less
 * Going to the past and requesting an item from the pawnbroker will result in that item being available the next day
 * Trade in the fireproof suit for a scuba suit (and vice versa) at some shop
 * Todd wants to rebel against Merchant-bot and leaves clues to help you do so
 * Todd works mornings at the Ritzy Inn

 *    Club Room - Time Machine  - Free on First Access
