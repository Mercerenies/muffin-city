-------- EVENTS --------

1. Robbery Event (city-thug)
  (*) no
      After the first visit to the Shady Alley, the player will be told that someone is watching them.
      The game proceeds to state `stalking`.
  (*) stalking
      If he goes to the police station, he will have the option of telling the police he is being
      followed, resulting in state `chasing`. If the player goes to the shopping or hotel districts,
      then the robber leaps out and strikes, pointing a gun in the player's face and demanding money.
      The player can cooperate (if they actually have money), refuse, or claim to have none.
      - Cooperate - The player gives up either a silver coin or a platinum credit card and the robber
        runs off. The game moves to state `island`.
      - Claim (truthfully) - If the player truthfully has no money, the robber will let him go and
        return to state `no`.
      - Claim (falsely) - The robber will call the player on his lie and act as though he refused.
      - Refuse - The player will be shot and will go to Underworld. The robber will go hide out on
        Dream Train to avoid the police. Move to state `hiding`.
  (*) chasing
      The robber will keep a low profile and will not be able to be found. In this state, the Shady
      Alley will reveal a Silver Coin. If the Shady Alley coin has been collected (sa-coin) and
      the player goes to the Underworld hub, then the game moves to `no`.
  (*) island
      The robber will end up on the Warehouse island. The player can talk to him. The robber will
      say that he ended up not needing the player's money and will return whatever he stole
      (stolen-good). He will then leave and the game will revert to `no`. Alternatively, telling
      the police will result in the `hunted` state. If the player approaches the Warehouse island
      while Attorney-Man is also serving justice there (attorney-man in state `fed` or above),
      Attorney-Man will automatically chastise him, sending the game back to `no` and returning
      the stolen item.
  (*) hiding
      The robber will be on the Dream Train. The player can talk to him, where he will apologize for
      shooting the player and claim that it was "just business". The game then moves to `no` as the
      robber leaves the train. Alternatively, if the player pulls the emergency brake, the robber
      will run off into the moonscape, and the game will move to `no`.
      //// What then?
  (*) hunted
      The robber will be caught and moved to the dining hall in the prison. If the player talks to
      him, the game moves to `caught`.
  (*) caught
      If the player talks to the police (with a clean criminal record, according to the Trial Event),
      they will present him with the stolen good he lost. If the Platinum Card has not been obtained
      (thug-card), they will also present him with that, and he will be asked to choose which one was
      his. After doing so, the game reverts to `no`.

2. Trial Event (trial-crime)
  (*) no
      The player has not been arrested. When the player is arrested for confessing to murder, the
      game will go to state `court`, trial-reason will go to state `murder`, and the player is
      moved to the courtroom, where the trial will proceed. If the player should end up in
      prison in this state, he can speak to the warden, who will promptly release him with an
      apology.
      //// Warden stuff is not in the game right now
  (*) court
      The player is given the option to plead guilty or innocent. If he pleads guilty, he is
      convicted. If he pleads innocent and lacks a lawyer, he will be convicted anyway. In the case of
      conviction, the game moves to `prison` and the player is moved to prison. Once again, if the
      player ends up in prison, the warden will happily release him. Alternatively, he can use Dr.
      Cipher in the Underworld to reset this state to `no`.
      //// Lawyer?
  (*) prison
      In this state, if the player moves to the police station, he will be apprehended and tried in
      court, moving back to state `court`. If the player visits Dr. Cipher, his Document
      Transmogrifier will reset this to `no`.
      //// Lawyer?

3. Gate Guard Event (prison-guard)
  (*) no
      The prison guard stands at the gate. The player can talk to him and bribe the guard with a
      Silver Coin, releasing the player back to the city and moving to `paid`. Note that even though
      the player has been freed from prison, he does not have a clean record and will be arrested on
      sight if he returns to the police station.
  (*) paid
      If the player ends up in prison again, the guard will still be there. He will initially resist
      releasing the player but will relent when reminded of the bribe. The player is released and the
      game moves to `fired`.
  (*) fired
      The third time the player is in prison, there will be a female guard in place of the original
      guard. She will not be amenable to bribes and will not release the player. When the player
      speaks to her, the game moves to `search`.
  (*) search
      The mustached guard is sitting in the corner of the dream world airport. The player can
      speak to him, and he will complain about being fired. If Attorney-Man is accepting clients
      (attorney-man), then the player will have the option to tell the guard about Attorney-Man.
      If he does so, the attorney-guard flag will be set to `okay`. In this state, when the player
      arrives at the prison's gate, attorney-guard will be set to `seen` and the game will move
      to `cleared`.
  (*) cleared
      The guard is grateful to the player for helping him and will release him from prison whenever
      he wants. If the player asks the guard about Attorney-Man, attorney-guard will be set
      to `yes` and attorney-man will be updated to reflect the new client.

4. Johnny Death Event (johnny-quest)
  (*) no
      Johnny Death is in the Underworld balcony and is seeking souls for his display case. When the
      player encounters him, he will ask for help stealing souls for his display. If the player
      accepts, he will be given the Soul Crystal and the Elevator Access Key so that he can exit
      the Underworld. The game moves to `accepted`.
  (*) accepted
      Johnny is waiting to receive souls from the player. The souls that are available are in
      the prison exercise fields (exercise-soul), the subspace taco shop (guard-soul), and ...
      When the first soul is brought to him, Johnny will tell the player about Dr. Cipher's
      invention and the game will move to `1`.
  (*) 1
      Johnny is waiting to receive more souls. When the second soul is brought to him, Johnny
      will upgrade the player's Elevator Access Key into an Upgraded Elevator Access Key. The
      game will then move to `2`.
  (*) 2
      Johnny is waiting for one more soul. When the third and final soul is brought to him,
      Johnny will open all the doors in the lobby, giving the player access to all of the
      rooms. In particular, this opens the mercury room, which contains the Cream Cheese
      Muffin. The game also moves to `done` at this time.
  (*) done
      Johnny's collection is complete. If the player speaks to him, he will simply thank
      the player.

5. The Butler's Event (butler-game)
  (*) no
      The butler is nowhere to be found. The game will move from this state to `cell` when
      the following three conditions are met.
      - The player has just been arrested and moved to the prison.
      - The player has been arrested before (been-to-prison).
      - The player has at least one item.
  (*) cell
      The butler is in the player's prison cell. When he talks to him, he will tell the player
      about the science lab and how to get to it. The game will move from this state to `pawn`
      when the following three conditions are met.
      - The player has just entered the pawn shop in the present.
      - The player has talked to Dr. Louis (talked-to-louis).
      - The player has jumped into the fire pits (jumped-into-fire).
  (*) pawn
      The butler is in the pawn shop in the present. When he talks to him, he will give the
      player a Fireproof Suit.
      //// Next state

6. Attorney-Man's Career (attorney-man)
  (*) no
      Attorney-Man has not been spoken to, so he will only appear in Shabby Jack's in the past.
      After he introduces himself, the player can encourage him or walk away. In the first case,
      the game moves to `talked`. In the second case, it moves to `met`.
  (*) met
      The player has spoken to Attorney-Man. If he speaks to him again, the same options as in `no`
      will be presented. If the player walks away, nothing happens. If the player encourages him, the
      game moves to `talked`.
  (*) talked
      Attorney-Man in the past will say simply that he will embark on a journey soon. In the present,
      Attorney-Man appears on the northern side of the warehouse island. When spoken to, he will ask
      for a taco and the game will move to `talked1`.
  (*) talked1
      Attorney-Man in the past will continue saying he will embark soon. In the present, Attorney-Man
      remains on the warehouse island and continues asking for food. If the player has given the
      Taco Man an olive (taco-shop is `olive` or `fed`), then the player can request a taco from
      the Taco Man. Delivering this taco to Attorney-Man moves to the game to `fed`.
  (*) fed
      In this state, Attorney-Man will wait for cases. The player can deliver his own case
      (attorney-self), the robber's case (attorney-thug), and the prison guard's case
      (attorney-guard). Each of these moves the game forward, first into `1`, then `2`,
      then `done`.
  (*) 1
      See `fed`.
  (*) 2
      See `fed`.
  (*) done ////
  (*) complete ////

7. The Taco Shop (taco-shop)
  (*) no
      The player has not spoken to the taco shop manager. When he does so, the game moves to `spoken`
      or to `olive` if the player has an olive. Joe the Time-Traveler will be in the subspace hub
      and will simply complain about hunger.
  (*) spoken
      The player has spoken to the taco shop manager but has not presented him with an olive. The
      taco shop manager will be looking for an olive. When presented with one, the game will move
      to `olive`. Joe the Time-Traveler will still complain about hunger.
  (*) olive
      The player has presented the taco shop manager with an olive. If the player talks to Joe
      the Time-Traveler, the game will move to `fed` and Joe will move to the taco shop.
  (*) fed
      Joe the Time-Traveler will, upon being asked, tell the player about the secret password
      to the pawn shop in the past. The game will remember that he has done so (pawn-shop-pass).
      //// More to this quest

8. The Hunter's Adventure (hunter-trail)
  (*) no
      The player has not visited the forest outside the prison yet. The Hunter is at Shabby
      Jack's and will simply say he is looking for a good forest to hunt in. When the player
      visits the forest, the game will move to `visited`.
  (*) visited
      The player has visited the forest but not told the Hunter about it. When the player tells
      the Hunter, who is still at Shabby Jack's, about it, the game will move to `forest` and
      the Hunter will move to the forest.
  (*) forest
      The Hunter is in the forest. When the player speaks to him here, the player will have
      the option of suggesting that the Hunter go to the cave. If he does so, the game will
      move to `under` and the Hunter will move to the Underworld.
  (*) under
      The Hunter is in the Underworld.

9. Trip to Subspace (subspace-reason)
  (*) no
      The player has not been sent to subspace yet. If the player ends up in subspace in this
      state, he has done so without causing a paradox or otherwise. When the player is sent to
      subspace, depending on the reason, the game will move to `arrest`.
  (*) arrest
      The player was sent to subspace as a result of confessing to a crime in the past. This
      implies that the player had an unclean criminal record at the start of the present day,
      which contradicts the order of events.

10. Evil Flame Spirit (fire-pit)
  (*) no
      The player has not begun to approach the evil flame spirit. When the player visits the
      fire pits with the Fireproof Suit, the game will move to `odd`.
  (*) odd
      The player has been to the fire pits successfully once. When the player visits the starting
      area of the big city, the game will move to `even`.
  (*) even
      The player has been to the pits and back once. (//// Player must have at least two
      science keys)
  (*) next
      ////
  (*) seen
      ////
  (*) talked
      //// And the rest ...

11. The Necromancy Certificate (necro-cipher)
  (*) no
      The player has not spoken to Dr. Cipher about his Necromancy Certificate yet. If the
      player talks to Dr. Cipher after the Butler's second event (butler-game is `pawn` or
      beyond) and after using the pawn shop password (pawn-shop-pass is `yes`), Dr. Cipher
      will seem mildly alarmed by something. If the player asks what is wrong, Dr. Cipher
      will explain that his Necromancy Certificate has been stolen.
  (*) spoken
      The player has been sent to look for the Necromancy Certificate. Joe the Time-Traveler
      will have it at the taco shop in subspace. When the player approaches him, Joe will
      insist that it is a family heirloom, not a cursed artifact. If the player presses him,
      he will not give, but the game will move to `found`.
  (*) found
      The player has found the Certificate, but Joe will not give it up. The player must return
      to Dr. Cipher and share his findings. When the player tells Dr. Cipher, he will confirm
      that Joe's scroll is in fact the Certificate and tell the player to claim the Certificate
      at all costs. The game will move to `encouraged`.
  (*) encouraged ////
  (*) rising ////
      //// So the player will go to Dr. Cipher, who doesn't know who has stolen it. Then, if
      the player sees Joe, he will notice a mysterious scroll that Joe is reading. If confronted,
      Joe will say it's a family heirloom. The player will have to go back to Dr. Cipher, who will
      confirm that it is the Certificate. When the player next confronts Joe after this, he will
      insist that Cipher is the bad guy. The player can choose to disbelieve him (he'll be ignored)
      or to confront Cipher. Cipher will once again send the player back to Joe, who has now begun
      summoning the spirits of the dead. They will kill the player if he approaches Joe, so he must
      seek the help of Atheena, who will save the world with her Hero's Blade.

TEST:
 * Johnny Death, start to finish
 * Attorney-Man, start to finish
 * Merchant-bot, I'm just happy these lines line up so nicely

NOTES:
 * Cave will lead somewhere cool if you have a light (inverse city)
 * Given gift if falsely imprisoned (according to Warden), maybe Religious Artifact
 * Past the fire pits, there should be multiple rooms which are accessible, not just the freight elevator
 * Merchant-bot has two items (one at a ridiculous price); there is a quest to kill him, which leads to the warehouse office. At that time, Merchant-bot 2 takes over and sells the expensive one for less
 * Going to the past and requesting an item from the pawnbroker will result in that item being available the next day
 * Trade in the fireproof suit for a scuba suit (and vice versa) with Todd
 * Todd wants to rebel against Merchant-bot and leaves clues to help you do so
 * Help someone escape from prison by creating a diversion on entry
 * The subspace bank forecloses some important building or structure, requiring you to break into their vault to get the key and reopen it (Hero's Crystal)
 * Diving into the warehouse island water with scuba suit will result in an underwater merfolk cavern
 * The mechanic is missing his Golden Wrench, which is (probably) in the undersea kingdom. With it, he can repair the player's broken objects
 * Steve's Smash-a-Lock (only open in the past), where you can have Steve break open the vault lock to get Atheena's crystal back. Also, Steve may give you a Suspicious Briefcase that you must deliver to present-day Steve in the prison.
 * Evil flame spirit appears in the fire pits after N visits. After appeasing him by giving him something, ... I dunno, something happens ... (Necromancy Certificate? Joe?)
 * The Ancient Minister will tell you how you ended up in subspace (mainly to help the player understand). If the player has no record of entering subspace in any "standard" way, then his heart will be pure and the Minister will speak to him more frankly, and then.... something.... (the record of entering subspace can be cleared with Dr. Cipher's help)
 * Dr. Cipher wants his Necromancy Certificate back from Joe. Is Joe secretly a supervillain who wants to use the Certificate to rule the world? If so, the player probably has to go call on Atheena to save the world from him. One of the rewards from defeating Joe, in addition to a Black Olive stolen from the Taco Man, is that the portal to the underworld will remain open, providing a one-way path into a new part of the underworld, filled with dark souls and evil magic. Perhaps the Certificate is torn? You have to get it repaired?
 * Science Johnson controls the console room. His soul is in the abyss area and needs to be rescued, but once it is, he will end up outside the door to the controls in the console room and explain the goal of the game to the player, as well as possibly give him hints once he has X muffins.

 * Turn-based RPG-style combat for Joe and Merchant-bot
 * Hunter, inmate, and second prison guard souls for Johnny Death
 * Attorney-Man and the three clients (player, guard, and robber)
 * The stolen luggage will let you hide in the cargo hold of the dream train to make it back to the dream world

 * -- Shrinking item but requires certain power port (purple outlets) to use --
 * -- On the opposite side of the narrow tunnel in the Underworld (accessible with shrinking item), you can access the secret elevator which goes to the warehouse island --

SCIENCE:
 *    Club Room - Time Machine  - Free on First Access
 *   Spade Room - Time Machine+ - ???
 *   Heart Room - Shrinking     - Dr. Cipher Quest
 * Diamond Room - Rocket        - ???
